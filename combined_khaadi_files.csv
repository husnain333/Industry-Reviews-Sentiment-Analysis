Wrong size
For not receiving my parcel
Description(size) of the items was wrong and the customer service inappropriately responded inspite of details I provided
"I got a dress, but in the details, it said a shirt and pants were part of the deal. It didn‚Äôt say they were matched, just that they were included. When the package arrived, only the shirt was inside. I reached out to them, but they never got back to me. This is the worst customer service I've ever experienced‚Äîtotally irresponsible. What a shame!"
"Fantastic service! My package arrived in just 7 days from Pakistan to Jeddah, and it‚Äôs always this speedy üëç. Much appreciated!"
I consistently buy from the Uk online Sana Safinaz site and have never faced any issues. They usually deliver my clothes in about two weeks and even give me a call to check if I'm satisfied with my order. I've told everyone about them and plan to keep shopping here. Thanks a bunch!
"This is the worst experience I've had. The dress I received looks nothing like what was shown in the catalog. I wouldn't suggest this to anyone, not ever!"
"I recently bought a few shirts from Sana Safinaz to ship to the US. I was really surprised by how fast the delivery was. They gave me a tracking number, and everything I received was in excellent shape. I just don‚Äôt get why folks are griping about poor service and low quality. If you haven‚Äôt visited Pakistan in a while, you might not know what‚Äôs trendy. Those who are unhappy should probably shop at the cheap-looking Indian boutiques in the US and Canada if they want that 80's vibe. This brand is solid, and I was really pleased with my order."
"I've never encountered such poor customer service. If you offer WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger support, you should either inform customers that they‚Äôll be in a queue or reply to them like other companies, such as Ikea. With a business this size, you ought to be able to provide better assistance. It's really unacceptable right now. It took me about 48 hours to get my order placed."
"This company is pretty dodgy and their customer service is lacking. They haven't sent out my order yet. Seriously, steer clear of buying anything from Pakistan; their business approach doesn't focus on the customer."
"Avoid this dishonest business. They took my cash and are not giving it back since the item is unavailable, suggesting a credit note instead. I can't believe they operate like this. I really hope they turn things around because they are gradually destroying their reputation. This Marina Khan from customer service is terrible, not responding to my emails even after multiple follow-ups for a refund."
"Steer clear of this site! I made a big order for some clothes, and the quality of what I got was way below my expectations. The garments were poorly made, and the fit was off. When I reached out to SANA SAFINAZ's customer support for assistance, they were totally unhelpful. The service was just terrible. Nowhere did it mention that returns weren't allowed when I placed my order, which is just wrong. I'm honestly shocked by this company, SANA SAFINAZ, and their outrageous behavior. I won't be ordering from them again and strongly recommend that others think twice because of the issues I've faced."
"I ordered a suit but ended up with a faulty dupatta. I reached out to customer service, and they sorted it out in just two days by sending me a replacement dupatta. Really impressed with their support!"
"I‚Äôm really let down by Sana Safinaz. I placed an order for their winter collection online, and they took the money from my card the very next day, but I still haven‚Äôt received my dresses. It‚Äôs been over a month of me trying to get in touch with them, but it‚Äôs been useless. Seriously, don‚Äôt buy from their website. They‚Äôre just a bunch of scammers. When they spot international customers, they take advantage of them. They charge your debit card and then don‚Äôt send the package. I‚Äôm highly disappointed with Sana Safinaz."
"I'm really let down by Sana Safinaz. They took money from my debit card the day after I placed my order, but I still haven't received my package. It's been over a month now. They keep coming up with ridiculous excuses. Honestly, they're just a bunch of frauds. Seriously, don't buy anything from their site."
"Sana Safinaz is my favorite label. I can always find outfits for any occasion at SS, be it a wedding, Eid, or just for everyday office wear.I just placed an order from their new Mahay collection, which is super budget-friendly and features stunning, vibrant prints."
"I got my hands on their newest Mahay Winter collection and I gotta say, I was quite taken aback by the quality for just PKR 3,999. Seriously, it‚Äôs a solid bang for your buck. On top of that, their team was super helpful when I needed to change my address. I had two places and ran into some trouble, so I shot them an email to update my info, and they were really quick to sort it out."
"Customer support that really helps. I ran into some trouble when trying to pay with my card, but they were super helpful and often resolved my problem. I'm always pleased with their service and the quality of what I buy."
"Super helpful... ran into an issue with the size I ordered. I went for a smaller item than I typically get, and when I raised my concern, they sent me a replacement at no extra cost and didn‚Äôt even ask for the old one back. I‚Äôd definitely recommend them!"
"I bought something and forked out more than ¬£100, only to find out they took my cash and then claimed it was out of stock. After a bunch of emails, I was informed that I would get my money back in full. The refund ended up being just 48p. Unbelievable, steer clear of this company! When I followed up, they insisted they had refunded the entire amount!!!! Still waiting to hear back!"
"Absolutely terrible, just don‚Äôt buy from them!!!!! I was shocked for a brand that‚Äôs supposed to be reputable. I placed my order ages ago and it still hasn‚Äôt shown up. They‚Äôve given me ZERO feedback; it feels like they just want your cash and then vanish! If you need something quickly or expect any kind of customer support, avoid them like the plague!!! I‚Äôm still waiting on my clothes and had to fork out $300 for shipping on a 300000 rupee order. Totally let down!!!"
"Wow! I really wish I had checked out these reviews first! I definitely wouldn‚Äôt have made a purchase from them. I‚Äôm going through the same issue. I placed my order, they took my money, but there‚Äôs been zero movement on shipping it out. What a shady brand!"
"Update #2: My shipment arrived on schedule, but man, the clothing quality is super low for what I paid! The blue kurti looks totally different in real life and it's see-through! I gave a couple of the other suits as gifts, hoping they‚Äôre better quality, in sha Allah. The first kurti (black and white) that cost $60 is also really cheap. Honestly, it felt like I was draping a tablecloth over myself instead of wearing comfy clothes. I'm pretty let down, but at least my order came through. Just a bit anxious about the dress that set me back $137.60. Fallahu khairun hafizan wa huwa arhamur rahimeen.Update #1: The morning after I posted this, they shot me an email saying my order was shipped. I‚Äôm really hoping to bump this rating up to 5 stars and wipe out my earlier comments! Just a heads up: I‚Äôve upped my rating from 1 star to 4 stars.Original Comment: I‚Äôll either change or delete my review, but if that‚Äôs not an option, I‚Äôll drop a five-star review only if their service gets better. My first purchase was for Eid ul-Fitr (totaling $110 CAD). I ordered late, yet they rushed my order and I got my clothes in just 9 days. Because of that awesome experience, I went ahead and placed a bigger order for about $500 CAD. It‚Äôs been 17 days now, and no one‚Äôs replied to my messages on Facebook or my emails. I really hope this isn‚Äôt a scam because I‚Äôd hate to drag my parents into this. When I do, they don‚Äôt think twice about taking legal action. Plus, my cousin‚Äôs a lawyer, so that makes things a whole lot easier."
"Their customer service is just terrible. They took my payment for the dresses, claiming the delivery got canceled, but I‚Äôm not getting any replies or my money back. On top of that, I keep getting emails about someone else's order instead of mine. It's so unprofessional."
"Steer clear of Sana Safina!!! Their customer service is absolutely terrible, and you won't hear back from them. I ordered a suit, but the dupatta was missing, and they did nothing about it‚Äînot even a reply to my emails or WhatsApp messages. I faced the same issue with another suit, and once again, no action was taken. Now, I've got yet another suit with a missing dupatta and an embroidered neckline that‚Äôs also gone, and still no response. They‚Äôre fortunate to be in Pakistan; if they were in the UK, they‚Äôd be facing serious legal issues. They seem to have no fear of consequences! Not even a hint of fear of Allah. It‚Äôs the biggest scam!

"I was mistakenly billed twice for the same order. Seriously, steer clear of this brand! They don‚Äôt respond to messages or emails, and I still haven‚Äôt seen my refund. Just avoid them, please."
"What a terrible shopping experience! The images on the site look great, but you really don‚Äôt get what you expect. For instance, I received a low-quality scarf instead of the one that was shown. The fabric quality is just not up to par. Customer support is a nightmare; it can take ages to resolve even simple issues like getting a refund. You might find yourself sending 20-30 emails just to get a reply. They keep passing you around to different staff members who just keep asking the same questions. It seems like Sana Safinaz doesn‚Äôt care about customer service at all; once they get your money, you‚Äôre on your own. It‚Äôs a real hassle, so I‚Äôd say skip it."
"I got a kurti that was all messed up. I quickly reached out to them on WhatsApp, and all I got was 'wait, wait, and wait' for a solution. What a terrible experience with Sana Safinaz! The fabric quality ain't as good as what they flaunt in the pictures. I ordered lawn, but they sent me a different fabric that had a huge hole in the shirt. They‚Äôre just like those sellers on Daraz. Such a low-quality brand."
"A tip before you buy from them, especially if you're outside of Pakistan. Use a credit card to ensure you're covered by section 75. If you're using a debit card, make sure to go for a chargeback. Steer clear of PayPal since you'll need to dispute the direct debit payment with them. What you see ain't what you get. Just total rubbish. Remember, you can reclaim your cash through the banks."
"Always use a credit or debit card for your purchases, 'cause section 75 and chargeback can have your back if you're not happy with what you receive. Just a heads up, what you order might not match what shows up. Make sure to file those disputes. Steer clear of PayPal for this stuff, since you'll need to handle disputes with them on your own."
I purchased four suits and the quality is really low. It's not worth the cash or the hassle. I'm so bummed about wasting my time and energy.
"For a well-known brand, the fabric is just plain awful and feels cheap. Nothing resembles the images they showcase on their site. Their policies for exchanges and refunds are downright ridiculous; this should be made clear on the website. Seriously, steer clear of this company! The quality is just terrible. I ordered some Eid outfits, and my order number was 11000242004. When it showed up, it looked nothing like what was advertised. Plus, I was charged different prices for the same outfit. The dresses are beautifully marketed, but the material is really bad and looks totally different."
"I recently bought an outfit from Sana Safinas for Eid, and honestly, I was not expecting such a poor experience from a high-end brand. The clothes I received looked nothing like what was advertised, and the quality of the material was just terrible. When I tried to leave a comment on Instagram, instead of getting a response, my comments were deleted! The staff were quite rude too. What kind of customer service is this?"
"I made my purchase, paid up, and then got my order cancelled right before Eid for no good reason!! Then they attempted to bill me for an order I never even made!! AVOID ORDERING FROM THEM, IT'S A ROTTEN SYSTEM AND THE STAFF ARE INCOMPETENT."
"I came across the dress online in white and yellow, but it turned out to be nothing like the white shade I expected. Even the lighting effects didn‚Äôt help much. They really mislead buyers, and the return policy is such a hassle that I ended up getting it altered, but I'm still not thrilled with the dress... total waste of money."
"I placed an order for a suite more than two weeks back, but they delivered a completely different fabric. A lot of the items that were supposed to be included are nowhere to be found, despite what was promised in the description. This has been a really disappointing experience."
"I had a really awful time shopping here. I bought some clothes for my kids, and one of them was just terrible in quality. They told me I‚Äôd only get 15 bucks back if I ordered more stuff. I ended up spending 70 dollars on those clothes üòî. They are just full of tricks."
"Terrible customer support. I placed my order over two weeks ago and it‚Äôs still not here. The phone number is useless, so I reached out via WhatsApp. They told me delivery is on the way, but I haven‚Äôt received any email about it. Then they said they attempted delivery but couldn‚Äôt find my place! What a load of rubbish, they offered no help and I‚Äôm still left hanging for my order. Just pathetic."
"I made an online order, but my package still hasn't arrived, and it's been over 10 days. The customer support is just awful! This brand is the worst! Shopping online with Sana Safinaz was my biggest blunder. Really, the service is just terrible."
"I‚Äôm really let down by the support I received. I wanted to swap my order for a bigger size, and while someone reached out, there was zero follow-up. Given how popular this online store is, I thought I‚Äôd get top-notch service. Just so disappointed."
"I placed an order for an outfit on the site this past Tuesday and paid for it, only to get a message saying the item was out of stock. Then, I spotted the same item again on Wednesday, so I tried to order it once more, but guess what? Another email popped up saying it‚Äôs out of stock again. They really ought to keep an eye on what they‚Äôre advertising and their inventory, don‚Äôt you think?"
"This well-known brand has the worst service, misleading folks and leaving you hanging at the last moment. I ended up with no outfit for Eid. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend shopping with them if you‚Äôre in a pinch."
"I‚Äôd kick things off with a zero rating. They‚Äôre total frauds, sending materials that are laughably different from what‚Äôs shown in the pictures. It‚Äôs not even in the same ballpark as the original piece. Don‚Äôt be fooled by their million followers on Instagram; I fell for that trap too. It‚Äôs really disappointing."
"I got my hands on their latest collection, Mahy 2021, and let me tell ya, it‚Äôs a total rip-off. I paid 2490 for a two-piece set, thinking I was getting something nice. I ordered two dresses, but the quality is just plain awful, like those cheap phatty k kapry. They really took advantage of folks with their flashy TV ads, making us believe the dresses would be great. But in the end, what we got was just trash. Seriously, don‚Äôt waste your money on anything from Sana Safinaz; the quality is terrible."
"I placed an order for over 1 lakh (around $800) worth of unstitched suits from Sana Safinaz. The dresses appeared stunning in the photos, but what I got was complete trash. The actual garments looked like terrible knock-offs! They bore no resemblance to the pictures at all! What a letdown. Sana Safinaz charges outrageous prices for such subpar items. I reached out to them multiple times and got no response - what a shocker. They sell their junk and then vanish. This isn't how a successful business operates. Karma's coming for them! :)"

"I truly wish I could give this a zero rating. This company is just the worst. I've had the same issues as many others, like no refunds and orders that go missing or are suddenly out of stock. The customer service is absolutely terrible and offers no assistance. Seriously, do yourself a favor and avoid ordering from this place. It's shocking that they refuse to issue refunds; you practically have to fight to get one when they mess up!"
"Terrible customer support. We've been reaching out since April 3rd because they sent us a damaged item, but still no reply. Just a friendly tip: steer clear of online shopping with *******@sanasafinazofficial.I tried visiting their stores, called them, sent emails, and even messaged on WhatsApp. But nada. Each time, they promise to get back to you, but nobody seems to care.Think twice before placing an online order with Sana Safinaz."

"I live in Toronto and recently ordered online from a few clothing stores in Pakistan (Saphire, Alkaram store) 
My experience with Kayseria was the best one with regards to online, and store both. Some items were sold out online and for some I needed 3 meters fabric instead of the standard 2.5 meters shown online. I called their customer care to inquire. They suggested if it‚Äôs possible I should check with their local stores in Karachi. I contacted Kayseria store at Lucky One mall and Mr Yusuf took my call. I had an amazing superb experience dealing with him. He showed me my preferred fabrics on WhatsApp call and advised about the fabric quality and other details. With his help I was able to select 5 embroidered lawn suits and Dupattas. 
He packed them for me and my cousin picked up from the Kayseria store at Lucky One mall the next day. 
Exceptional impressive service from Mr Yusuf that is not known in Pakistan. The other stores of other clothing brands never pick up their phone despite repeated calls. 
The customer care at Kayseria is also remarkable and immediate response is received. I love the embroidered Dupattas and fabric at Kayseria and always buy from them in my visit to Pakistan. 
I must mention stay away from Saphire and Alkaram stores, they can make you regret dealing with them. 
I would again thank the team at Kayseria for helping me out of way to make it possible for me to get exactly what I was looking for üòÑ"

Very good and affordable products are provided through LAAM.
"Terrible customer service!!!! I ordered for over 300$. Lots of cloths foe Eid and for kids. All the sizes sent to me were ronh. For exemple for my12 years old I ordered 11-12 but got a 7. I messaged the customer service and they asked me to send the pictures with measurement tape. I did. Then they told me because it's an international order, they cammot do amy refund and not exchange. Even though on their website the policy indicates that they can provide a voucher if the sizes are wrong. Now I am stuck with glitch that does not fit anyone and Eid is only a week away ;( Never buying fom them again a d will NOT recommend."
"Best shopping experience ever , got my parcel within a week and everything was just perfect"
"I ordered 2 dresses from Laam, as Ive seen many positive views on Laam and how they'd always order from it, but when i received my order i wasn't satisfied at all and when i asked if i could exchange it with some other clothes they replied saying its not possible due to custom issues? This was absolutely ridiculous!! The stitching of the clothes was not very pleasing and the thread work was falling out... I asked for a compensation at least on this matter but no reply... the clothes was not even worth the price... PLS DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE... I ordered from here due to the fact that Eid is coming up and it would be difficult to go and buy and look for clothes in person but I dont think im going to buy again from online... its very sad and harsh reality, atleast if not refund, exchange should be allowed... if your living in abroad looking for desi clothes, please try Khaadi, they never disappoint, I should have gone there to be honest now..."
"I‚Äôm extremely frustrated with the delayed response regarding my order. Because of thier slow communication, I missed the chance to make changes before it shipped. Just wanted to add one more dress in my purchase before shipping. This isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened, and it‚Äôs completely unacceptable. You don‚Äôt need to be quick in responding to reviews; you‚Äôve upset enough customers for them to come here and leave feedback. Take care of your customer service ‚Äî it needs more attention and care. No one will give a*** to quick response here! This will definitely be my last purchase. You providing just one number and saying 24/7 bs service but no calling system or emergency calls!. You pissed off enough of your good customers. Take care of your BS service on WhatsApp or messenger leaving just a text, they will reply whenever they wants or most likely after 2 days. It just not only Eid season! They have a dumb service since I know this website."
Fraud they tried taking money out from my acc and repeat payment setting thank God .my bank noticed it
Great experience ‚ù§Ô∏è I love it excellent quality üëçüèª
"Horrible experience with Laam, their stitching and sizing of the trousers is horrible. Too tied at thigh area. When I asked for a refund they said they are unable to accept returns from abroad. An absolute scam, I bought 13 articles and need to waste them all because it is not wearable at all. Horrible customer service, they just drag the case each time. Please don‚Äôt waste your money like I did."
Horrible Customer service! They never response.
"Definitely one of the worst custom service websites in Pakistan. The product are of poor quality and do not match the pictures shown on the website. All they want to do is sell! No exchange or return policy to facilitate customers. Honestly if you facilitate a customer they will shop with a peace of mind, but all they want to do is sell and  ghost you. I'll Never order againüëé"
Pathetic policy you have once you charge for shipping then again you charge for customs shouldn't it be included like other international deliveries and most important thing u Don't mention this at checkout time very Pathetic experience i have had typical pakistani behaviour
The product quality very cheap Ism very disappointed with the product quality
So happy with the quality of clothes and delivery from Laam. Wonderful experience from start to finish.
"They have a huge variety of clothes from different designers. They have ready to wear outfits and unstitched outfits. They have western and Eastern outfits and cater to children, men and women. Along with clothes, they have jewellery, shoes and other accessories, making it a one stop shop. They offer worldwide shipping and include duties, taxes, shipping and customs fees in their total price, therefore no added cost is required"
"A way much better than other expensive clothing brands!!Ordered multiple times, excellent service!"
I order by this website and it‚Äôs mentioned that I will get in in 2-3 days that‚Äôs why I pay much higher price and after placing order they send me message that it takes more than 12days so please be careful to order from these guys
the website is very simple and neat. it is constantly updated on what is available and not available. the whole process from ordering to delivery to the door is top. the quality of the packaging and delivery is very good
"I ordered from laam for the first time. I'm living in the UAE and I received my package within 5 days Alhamdulillah. The quality of the clothes is also great (i think that depends on the brand you choose). I also received an Eid Mubarak wish card from laam. It was the icing on the cake for me. Thank you Laam and wishing a great Eid to you as well. For ppl people facing problems, i guess it might be due to long distances and challenges in crossing several boundaries."
"Great experience doing online shopping from first ever website direct from Pakistan to UK. Free and quick delivery, can‚Äôt be more then happy with my purchase. 10/10 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
"i recieved my parcel but fabric of shirt is less. only 36 inches, width b buhhht kam. feeling sad"
I've had a wonderful experience with the service.
Overall great experience
I have ordered from Laam a few times now and have never been disappointed. The clothes are beautiful and the quality is excellent.
I placed an order on the Laam web site I accidentally added an zero to the amount Rs.84375 which made me send 8 lacs. I contacted their pathetic customer service but they aren‚Äôt helping me accordingly. Calling them is not possible. I‚Äôve been waiting for almost 2 weeks now for my refund üò°
Delivery was on time and the clothes were amazing and everything was perfect I happy with the outcome
"I came across "" Laam"" while searching for some clothes. I thought of giving it a try. When I wore it, people really admired and that really boosted my confidence in this company."
It's amazing experience and I would like to tell that LAAM doing great work to bring this application for shopping all the brands under one roof thanks to LAAM.
I ordered dresses on Laam first time and I am extremely happyü§©to see the pieces. The delivery took around 10days to reach to UAE. Insha Allah will go for new order from Laam.They are quick in response. Thank you
Ordered two dresses one of ZS & other one is crimson brand ...delivery was on time and best way packed delivery Really satisfied ‚ù§Ô∏è
"I ordered a suit from here. Website description and website photo showed PURPLE but when my suit arrived it was grey. I WISH I could insert a picture of how clearly obvious the colour difference is. The outfit is originally from the Baroque collection and checking on the baroque website the product description states ‚Äúgrey‚Äù, which shows Laam‚Äôs product description is clearly incorrect and misleading.When I contacted customer service about the issue and showed clear photo evidence of the colour difference and also screenshotted evidence of their product description which shows purple, they completely disregarded my whole email and replied ‚ÄúThe color is same as shown in the picture. The article in picture is also a light color‚Äù. ^a literal copy and paste The product description and photo both state ‚Äúpurple‚Äù not ‚Äúlight colour‚Äù. I‚Äôm ordering from the information being provided to me which is incorrect and you can see that she‚Äôs aware that this is not correct and therefore says ‚Äúlight colour‚Äù Evidently their customer service is absolutely useless and will do anything to keep your money. I would recommend using this company as a catalogue and when you find a suit you like, order from that companies actual website. Don‚Äôt put yourself at risk of not having an outfit on top of not being able to get the money returned for it. Especially when the shipping is not cheap. To point out they offered me 15% refund of the total, not a full refund"
"The shipping time was about 2 months to the UK but it was totally worth the wait and I ordered it way in advance sonI was in no rush. The garara came out exactly what I saw on the picture - very beautiful and the fit is great. The customer support was also really nice, responsive and helpful"
Suit not delivered on time. Still haven't got it.
"Very disappointing üòû... I still didn't receive my dress , I ordered it before Eid... Very bad service"
Love it but the delivery time was too mu h
Laam were not able to deliver a suit in Pakistan within 4 days. The shipment had arrived in Karachi and was sitting in Karachi for two days yet no one could be bothered to deliver it. I live in Dubai and a friend was meant to bring it back for me. Then I was told it wasn‚Äôt 4 days but 4 working days. Other companies managed to ship and deliver within two days in Pakistan. The customer service is absolutely appalling. First of all no one takes the calls. When speaking on WhatsApp the advisors are in a hurry to leave the conversation which I don‚Äôt understand why especially when it takes them hours to respond in the first instance. Not once did anyone apologise to me for the rubbish service or the fact that I didn‚Äôt recieve my shipment despite my numerous complaints.
It‚Äôs my first time by shopping from LAAM That was a great experience ü§©‚ù§Ô∏è Their dresses quality is soo good‚ù§Ô∏è Am sure am gonna buy again from LAAMüíï
Love Laam the clothes are absolutely stunning I wil continue to order from laam!!
"The dresses and the quality is really good i absolutely love it, but the website works really slow and also crashing and the express delivery always confuses me i always think it delivers on that date showed next to the dress"
"Fast delivery, good service, high quality, good communication, same as shown in listing and many more.I recommend this brand to all who has great choices for suits üëå üëç üëè"
"I love the texture color and quality of clothes,"
Laam Laam is very good and great company outfits look exactly like pictures. I have placed multiple orders from LAAM and never been disappointed very quick service.
"LAAM is a great, Products look exactly like pictures. I have placed multiple orders from LAAM and never been disappointed. Only the timeline is longer than usual for product delivery.Thanks"
Excellent service!!This was my 1st time to order with Laam but so impressed of their service and quality
First of all the number of brands they are offering is mind blowing. 2ndly They give information of each dress so well and in detail which make it easy to select. 3rdly the rates they are offering will make you buy more n more. 4thly the international delivery service is soo quick.
Great job and great work from laam very good price & quality I love it
Great customer service. I am happy with my recent order. All the dresses are awesome. I highly recommend Laam.pkThank you.
Great clothes!! Excellent customer service
Excellent service! Was able to track my parcel at all stages of the process.The suits were amazing! Better than the pictures!
Improve dilevery
"Initially i was scared to place an order but when i received my parcel all dresses are exactly same as picture. Quality,  price , materials everything is on point. This is my go to website now."
Overall a very good experience. The dresses i ordered matched exactly with their description. Prompt service n delivery.
I loved the dress and customer service is great. They respond very nicely. It would be nice if they add the option to lining the sleeves as many of the customers are hijabis/muslims. Thanks
First of all their services are soo great and they handle their customers so politely love them already. And now if i talk about their services for providing different designs from different brands it's all amazing . I have never experience anything negative from them .. I hope all the other pages should be like them
"Charging ""hidden"" fees. Very Disappinting. If youre an international customer please reconsider buying from laam. I paid for my order and shipping online and that should've been it right? nope, when the courier came to deliver they asked for more money in cash saying its ""customs fees"". I was never informed of this. Whats the point of paying online if they're still gonna charge me more in cash. so disappointing."
"Placed an order on May 16th. I was given a shipping date of June 1st. Never received tracking info. Contacted customer service and they said items will be shipped on June 3rd and ended the chat. Come June 3rd, received an email saying items will ship on June 10th.. then cancelled order saying they are having stock issues! I placed an order for 3 items. 1 of the items they said they have in stock but I asked them to cancel it. They had 15 days to inform me they didn‚Äôt have my products in stock! I could have changed them at that point. But they waited till after June 1st after I contacted them. Pathetic customer service was the cherry on top. Never again.To Respond to Laam‚Äôs automated response:No I don‚Äôt understand. 3rd party or not, if you don‚Äôt have the stock you notify your customers sooner. If you don‚Äôt know if your manufacturer has the stock you provide your customers with options and more importantly you provide decent customer service. If you look back on my chat, my chat was ended before the conversation was over. You look for ways to fix the issue on hand like ‚Äúok how can we make it better, would you choose something else that we can expedite shipping‚Äù instead of giving me 3 different dates then cancelling. So no I don‚Äôt understand how you run your business."
Very happy with the shopping experience. Convenient shopping from home. After placing my order I need to change the size of one item and they did it for me. Good customer service. App need some improvement it crashes sometimes and if you go back to previous page it takes you to top of the page that is frustrating. Some products need more pictures.But overall good experience.After they shipped it takes about 10 days to deliver to my home.
"Great quality of dresses at a very good price, the shipping was delayed but I was v happy with the quality and style after my order was delivered..."
LAAM is a great company with great services! Products look exactly like pictures. I have placed multiple orders from LAAM and have never been disappointed. Only the timeline is longer than usual for product delivery.
I got an email that estimated shipping will be 1st june and its 7th June now and still I didnt get any email or notification. They are not replying for my msgs/emails also and website is also not updated. Still showing processing.
I am very disappointed with Laam . This is my second time ordering to saudi arabia . I had placed order on 20th April and they said they shipped my order on 29th May . Since then there has been no update. Upon checking with the courier company they informed me that they have not yet received the package from Laam . The customer service replies seem automated stating that I would receive the parcel in 10-12 days. Its been 8 days and no movement or update . And the courier company claims that the parcel is Still with Laam . I really want them to solve my issue ASAP as I am traveling
"Order # 1288103 04th June Order placed, Option only prepaid, They are scammer, Once you paid your money gone, First shock even after paid delivery guy took handling and  customer charges, Once open pack got horrible products, They Sending old and cheap quality damage dresses, Requested for return , sent emails, whatsapp , Given number not having calling function only for whatsapp and email not responsing, Measn they ship junk and no refund no customer care, They are fraud and totally scammer , Don't even think about it.  Mobile # 0501925340"
I have 2 suits out of 5 and both are as expected. I‚Äôm happy with the overall experience.
pathetic service not refunded my money since 2 months‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-Re: no you didn‚Äôt refund and admitted and i have shared my bank statements with you and then you agreed that refund didnt process
"I had ordered a bridal dress from Laam on 4th May and was due to be shipped on 21st June. Today (4th June), out of the blue the order has been cancelled. I had not initiated this process but got an email in the morning about cancellation and refund. This was a bridal dress for my going to be sister in law. The team had contacted us for measurements, if this order could not be completed they should have informed us earlier and we would have looked at other options. I had expected a reliable service from LAAM and was severely disappointed. I contacted the customer team today but doubt I will get a response. I am quite distressed about arranging another bridal dress as where we live we don't have many options for ethnic bridal wear. Needless to say, please don't order from LAAM for such special occasions or you'll find yourself in a difficult position like myself."
I want to cancelMy order can you please respond Order number 1297076
I ordered from
"They have very poor customer service, I bought four shoes but only received three of them and I have emailed them to resolve this issue but they didn‚Äôt do anything. Though I have been shopping from laam but this time I was very disappointed."
Delivery was very good and kept informed. Clothes were all as listed except one child‚Äôs waistcoat as the size of the waistcoat was different to the size of the actual boys outfit. Clothes were as described
I am very happy to see my order and laam quality is best clothes are very beautiful and good thank you so much laam ü•∞
I ordered  from Newyork  it takes almost a month to get my package they delivered in two packages I just received only one still waiting for other package no response and no tracking information from them  highly recommended don‚Äôt get from laam
"I recently purchased a dresses online from LAAM, and I must say, it was an exceptional experience. The dress looked exactly like the pictures, which was a relief for a first-time buyer like myself. The prices were reasonable, and the quality of the dress was exceptional.However, the only downside was the shipping time. It took around 20-25 days for the dress to arrive, which was a bit longer than expected.my experience with LAAM was positive, and I will definitely be shopping from them again in the future. If they can improve their shipping time, it would make the entire experience even more enjoyable."
"Service by Laam is exceptional  , its my 2nd time buying from here.The whole lot of brands gives you a lot of options to choose from.In Australia  seasons go in opposite cycle as compared to Pakistan, so keeping this in review , it's suggestion for Team Laam to also put stuff according to our season also, it's winter here and we had to buy summer stuff.Overall the the Service by Laam is very prompt n quick."
Recently ordered a qalamkar suit from laam its really nice and timely delivered.
"I'm so happy to choose a really great site.The quality of fabric was so good. The delivery service is also very fast...Satisfied with this product , will shop again In Sha Allah.."
Good quality of clothes and love that delivery was not that expensive
They sent me an outfit without the material for the trousers?? What sort of company is this?I contacted them and they did not care and said they'd give me a 15% discount! Laughable!! So you don't send me a complete outfit and want me to spend more money on your website. Their reviews are obviously fake!Thankfully I used a credit card so will be contacting them who are opening up a dispute with them. I will also write a review on every single platform. I wish I could upload the response they gave. Worst customer service ever!!!!
"This is may be the fifth time i ordered from Laam. Staying in UAE i dont trust the authenticity of pakistani clothes here, if they are reasonable they might be fake and if they are authentic they are super pricey. I love LAAM because of their unbelievable prices, the authenticity and the quality of the pakistani brands. Also hats off to their customer service i have reached out to them through several means like emails whatsapp instagram, they always do respond to me which is think is very credible. Good luck to you guys and i will keep shopping through LAAM <3"
"I am sorry to give negative feedback, I have been Laam's loyal customer since 2019 and each time I face some problem or issues but this time I had very pathetic service for my Order # 1186776, I placed this order on 22 March 2024, the first issue online it was claimed to receive before Eid unexpectedly estimated shipping was 10 May 2024 and after many emails, I received a negative response so I waited patiently to receive until 10 May, and till this time there was no shipping confirmation and after follow-ups and email exchanges it was shipped on May 14th and was mentioned will receive in 4-6 working days, and today is May 28 I have not received after 11 working days, I would never again buy from LAAM and I would recommend all customers to look for other options instead of waiting for more than 2 months after paying for an order, I will post this on social media Twiter, Facebook, and other platforms so people don't get in this trap. Answering your response: You are changing your statement now It was supposed to be shipped on March 24th so I could receive it before Eid, I was disappointed but still accepted your reasons, and now you are saying after 2 months of order it is expected to ship late and now you are lying and changing your statement. Pasting email from LAM on May 4th  ""Hi, hope you are doing well.Order # 1186776 Your order shall be shipped within next 48 hours.Tracking link shall be emailed to you once shipped so that you can track it right to your doorstep.Please do note that once shipped, it further takes at least 2-4 working days to be delivered in Pakistan and 4-6 working days to be delivered internationally.Kind regards,Muniba RasheedLAAM"""
I am a regular costomer of LAAM.. every time i orders from LAAM the experience is great espacially the delivry mention time.. they deliver on exact time if any problem the team handle the situation very calmly .. Thank u LAAM for ur best service.. definetly i will shop again n again..
callcourier.com.pktracking tc=1103051006646I am very disappointed with your service. Not once have you tried to contact me regarding my order.When I got in touch with you.Your customer service was not helpful.Still have not received my item When asked where the order is? you just washed your hands and said it's with the courier and have not looked into the courier service to see what is happening.Not the standard of service I was expecting. I'm very disappointed.From 23/ 05/2024 still on going. You told us to contact the shipping agents which we did and they have lost it.So basically you wash your hands with this order and left us hanging so you service and your customer service was useless not acceptable at all very disappointed
"Sunday June 2Still waiting for my issue to be resolved I made my order on 30th April 2024 , I was informed via email and watsapp that my order will be shipped on 26th May. While I was emailing them for order status today on 27th May they told me that my order is being cancelled. I live in Dubai and have. Never experienced this kind of disappointment from any business house till date."
Alhumdulillah I'm fully satisfied üòç with dress with service everything is perfect üíó
"I really liked the dresses. But the problem is, I ordered two mprints from maria b. They just gave me one panel only and so many laces are missing totally. Not same as picture very disappointed"
Always an excellent experience with Laam. Thankyou for your service
Customer Service is good. Good quality products for great price. Highly recommend it!
"Affordable prices, and good selection to choose from. I received my package before the expected delivery date, so that was a nice surprise. The suits were beautiful."
üëç‚ò∫Ô∏è satisfied with quality and stuff
"I have ordered couple of times from LAAM, and always my experience was amazing. Quick delivery service and I recommend LAAM."
"Great experience  ! Customer service is amazing specially Ammara, she is the best ,she always help me and resolve my problems very quickly. Always recommend to my friends!"
"I have ordered from Laam a couple of times and every time the experience is really great. This time the items were beyond my expectations. The quality of the clothes, the service and their help chat on WhatsApp have been phenomenal. Thank you for your services. Will definitely be ordering again."
LAAM is the best . That‚Äôs my 3rd order. BTW mine 4th is on the way too üòÖüòÖ.according to the price dress quality super. Same as picture.
"We purchased around 40k PKR worth ladies dress. And they sent us 2 gents unstitch cloth. Strange.Then we tried to contact. They only have whatsapp chat option, again strange.Now after sending essages, we received a reply after a long day, they are asking us to send back those gents suits on our (customer) courier expense. Again strange. Don't know they will resolve the issue or not. Their mistake and we are suffering.Order number: 1274937"
"This was my first order from laam and it was great! All the articles were exactly as I expected mad matched the description on their page. The quality of the items I ordered was amazing! To top it all off, my shipment came in 9 days which is well ahead of when it was expected! I will definitely order from them again!"
"I don't have the option to give it below zero rating. Worst experience. Customer service doesn't bother to reply. Order number 1274937, trying to contact that I didn't receive my ordered dresses,  instead a plain black cloth. But no responce. Sent hundreds of request but no response."
Laam is the best plateform for online shopping very co-oprative staff
The quality the delivery timing the product i loved every single thing
Customer service very bad.And never take the item  returns once delivered. Also delivery will take 8 to 10days
I have had a great experience with LAAM thus far. Items were received around the time they indicated at the time of checking out. I would love for the shipping to be lowered even more to the US but $25 wasn‚Äôt that bad. Great items accessible to us who don‚Äôt reside in Pakistan. The only issue I have is that I was not able to use my reward points. I asked for assistance but no one was able to assist since the issue still persists.
"You can find all of Pakistan‚Äôs good designers‚Äô beautiful pieces at LAAM. Name your favorite designer, and you get it on the LAAM‚Äôs website. The original designs of all my favorite designers like Hussain Rehar, Faiza Saqlain, Fahad Hussayn, and every woman‚Äôs favorite ZaraShahJahan, I can get through them at very reasonable delivery prices. Being Indian and residing in California, I enjoy finding beautiful outfits from LAAM. The website's virtual chat is at the top of the mark. Ask them, and you will get the answer immediately. I used this website thrice to order my stuff this year, and my satisfaction is 100%."
Poor mishandling and deliberate damage to my suits. Poor customer service. Scarf was torn with a massive hole and other suit buy suffuse big hole in kameez. Always delivered later than scheduled delivery on site and invoice. I don't need to say anything else just look at the pictures. I have asked my uk card isurer to intervene.
"My experience with Laam is great. I had ordered 7 articles and All of them with respect to colors, fabric and stitching are really nice. They even return me the amount for 1 of my article which wasn‚Äôt available. I am hoping to have same great experience in future with quick delivery."
Awesome fabric and same aa shown in picture zabrdst quality thank u laam team will buy again feom u
The product is same as shown on picture. I really like it
"I orderd 5 dresses costed me ¬£173 pounds. The dresses were 1st copy of the original dress, pathetic colour and embroidery. When i asked for return they penalised me by only returning 20% of the original price i paid and then they said we are 3rd party and there is no damage we cant return. They doesn‚Äôt sell you whatever thy show you on website and once purchased and if you dont like it and want to return it they wont take back.. its a scam, please purchase from original website , dont waste your money on these 3rd parties which are looting people."
I have had a very bad experience with them. They are scammers never buy anything from them. They scammed me. They had mentioned one colour in the description which in actual was a totally different colour so i returned the dress which they told me to. I paid for the return as well. Tthey received the dress but they are not giving me the refund amount it's been almost a month since I'm trying to take my money from them but they are not giving me my money.
Whenever I bought from laam never disappointed.It has very good range of products.And mainly every product is 100% original.My go to online shopping store is laam.
It was amazing experience with LAAM and the quality was amazing too
Very good quality dress. As it is pictures. Good price just delivery delay otherwise everything is good. Dress is nice
"I have Contact laam 100 times on whatapp and e-mail they dont aswer me, they have Got a amount for 134709,09 Rs and sent My a gift card for 90240 Rs and they have not sent My order . They answer some other things. I Will never choice this way too come in contact with them. But know is 2 week and a have already pay and they don‚Äôt answer me and sent my packet ?? Why Laam ?"
Very bad product not as promised cloth not even close to the original pictures bad quality
"Fashionable dress and a reasonable price, good quality.    I damm liked it."
Laam never disappoints.Just got my prettiest mehndi outfit from Laam In U.S. Thankyou Laam .
I have been buying from LAAM since last couple of years. Have never been disappointed. Articles always looked exactly like the photos.
Hi I want to know which one is your original website? I saw your sale website where prices are mentioned all under dollar $9 .Is it for real ?
Hi id dont know what u ppl are doing no beeter staff my order u ppl are considering urself all wrong u ppl are doing one msg after four days anditerally stupid msg they dnt know what to do am saying contact me on my num bt they dnt know what to do
"Amazing quality of fabric and design was exactly like pictured. I was pleasantly surprised,  so thank you."
"I always buy my dresses from laam, I have never had a issues with any of the payments or outfits . It always came on time , exact picture shown online and when you received it it‚Äôs always on time . I will buy definitely buy again & recommended to friends and family !"
I have always enjoyed ordering from laam as the product is exactly the same as shown in picture and price worthy !
Bakwassss tareeen service hy .. advance payment ki phir inse payment nhi confirm hui itny din tk .. screenshot wagera sb diya .. phir payment confirm hou b gaye to order dispatch kiya or COD ka order dispatch krdiya .. woh payment dy k recieve krliya inky kehny py k ham apko apki advance payment refund krdengy .. ab 1 mahiny sy refund k liye rula rahy hain.. kbhi kehtu 1 hafta lgy ga kbhi kehty 2 din .. aaj keh rhy k woh to ham refund krchuky .. apni bank statment dou .. bjaye mjhy payment refund ka proof deny ka ulta mjhy mery bank ki statement mang rhy ghatiya log. Total scam
"Having placed 3 orders which have been cancelled for no reason, I asked for them to either place a delivery and have all 5 of my items sent to the address or provide a full refund. They lied and told me 2 of the items are out of stock all of a sudden when I can see they are very much in stock. Then they told me that they can give me a partial refund but only to a Pakistani bank account or a credit note. Now I've explained to them many times I paid via a UK bank account so  i would like to receive it in that same way, i do not want a credit note because i do not wish to shop from there again. So they need to decide whether they will stop playing games and send the clothes or give a full refund. I have been liaising with a Fatima who didn't really read my messages and sent me a gift card. Now what am i supposed to do with a gift card when they won't deliver the clothes...I am absolutely appalled by their service! I was reassured the clothes would definitely be delivered and I shouldn't have any hiccups. But once again they've messed me around...I ordered in Feb and now it's May, these were standard clothes not even made to measure there should be no problems."
Ya experience is good I am satisfied.time period is so long but I am so happy and I love LAAM.
Exceptional service and products. Extremely happy and satisfied with my purchase and Laam. Definitely will buy again and again.
I was very nervous ordering from Pakistan as there is always negative comments but I would like to say the service and clothes were beautiful I did have a few issues with delivery but were sorted out very satisfactory by the company
"They have HORRENDOUS customer service!  I ordered 8 items from them on Tuesday.  When I placed my order, the site stated that one of my items was out of stock so I confirmed my order for the items that they did have so I could at least get those on time.  Within a couple of minutes, I was requested again to ‚Äòconfirm my order‚Äô but this time, the item that was previously out of stock, had magically appeared.  I then confirmed the second order and IMMEDIATELY sent a message on whatsapp saying to cancel the first order.  I have yet to get a response back from them.  I then emailed them yesterday as well requesting my first confirmed order to be cancelled.  Again, no response.  Today I got a message saying my order was already on it‚Äôs way and to contact them again to return the items!  Today, items from both orders were delivered and because the person who accepted didn‚Äôt know that it was basically two of the same package, they accepted both.  Now I‚Äôve been trying to contact laam AGAIN all day today both by email AND whatsapp and have received no response.  This is absolutely disgusting and this isn‚Äôt how you run a business.  This is the second time I‚Äôve ordered from Laam and let me assure you, it will be the last time and I will not be recommending them to anyone else either!"
Their customer service is simply awful. They only have a WhatsApp number for international customers but only messaging is allowed and it‚Äôs an automated system. It disconnects you without any real resolution and the messaging takes days for a response. Their agents do not pay attention to what is being asked they‚Äôre too concerned with not being responsible for any concern that they don‚Äôt address the customers issue. The products are hit and miss as far as description/photo. They promote discounted shipping but fail to mention it takes weeks after shipment is mailed to reach you. They can do better.
The quality of the products+ the delivery time is enough to give 5 stars. Honestly it became my go to e-store!! I love it!!
I have a suggestion for that please available order Express because waiting for order too much üòç
"Over all i had a very good experience , its very convenient and easy to order , But when i received my parcel they asked me to pay some extra charges which was not mentioned anywhere in website"
My experience has been so bad. They have told me 4 times in the past few weeks that my order will be shipped within 48 hours but it has NOT been shipped yet!!! They say it‚Äôs at their warehouse but NO sign of shipment. I ordered my outfits almost 3 months ago!! I would not recommend them to anyone at this point!! Extremely frustrating!
I love Laam ‚ù§Ô∏è I shop 3 suit ant it‚Äôs amazing üëç
It's great experience to visit the LAAM website and ordered I love to ordered it again in further what I need in future related this ..
"Had a good experience so far, got my parcel within 10days. But I ordered another dress just after 2days of that it isn‚Äôt shipped yet. apart from that I have to say that the quality my dress was incredibe Alhamdulillah."
My experience is has been wonderful with laam. U can find beautiful outfits for all price points. I have been looking for a one stop shop for a long time. Who offer great customer service. I‚Äôm hooked.  My family will be a customer for a long time.
"Thank you very much for your delivery of my order my experience was good while dealing with you , one thing I want to inform you in your offer was mentioned free shipping delivery but Skynet courier company has charged 27 aed dirham (pk rupees 1800 ) was it in your knowledge, according my opinion it should be mention on your product."
"I have ordered 5 articles from laam,although received 1 yet and its amazing üëè very beautiful dress and team is very friendly and cooperative,   highly recommended thank üòä u laam"
Fraud. Stay clear off this business specially if you are not based in Pakistan. They are having fake reviews. They take your money and don‚Äôt deliver anything for months keep saying random items from you order delays. Then they have AI generated fake emails. No genuine concern for your order and no refunds.
i just ordered for the first time and it was just amazing wven nore than in the picture that i saw and purchase thank you Laam ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Ordered a dress from Rang e Haya from Laam and it was supposed to be delivered by 7th April. It is now 1st May and I have still not received my parcel. They hadn‚Äôt even shipped it until I contacted them a few days ago but still, no point now as I ordered it for an occasion which has now passed and dress is still not here."
The quality of product is very satisfying and will make purchase in future as well.
First time I ordered it from laam and it was amazing dress just like pic and also they delivered within 2/3 days I just love their dress
I have ordered twice and they took full payement and the orders are delayed they don't respond nor they attend the call been on call for 15 min many days. It has taken now 1 month and my suit is still not arrived. I was suppose to wear on wedding. I am still trying to contact them so I have more information. There should be quick response and they should deal professionally.
I ordered first time from Laam. It was my first time making any order from Pakistan. My experience was good I was surprised delivery was fast. Suit came quicker than I expected. Only thing is I think chameez material should have been included in the suit. Other than that I‚Äôm happy customer
It was a great experience with laamFirst time I was ordered from laam but I am extremely satisfied with the product
"I have shopped twice from LAAM, both of the times my experience has been great, and delivered as promisedHighly recommended"
"am so deeply disappointed with the service, when you ask specific questions about your delivery, you get the opposite answer, the track number you get is lousy, you don't get any information about delivery, I ordered several items from them, fast delivery, but still haven't received anything from my order, never shop with them again, delivery in pk 2-3 days, now it's been 7  days, still no information about where my items are. Hope that LAAM sees it and find me a salution"
I order the Afrozeh brand in laam so disappointed ‚òπÔ∏èüòû because replica suit and scam this aap I order unstitched suit.so bad experience . totally they send me wrong colour and wrong design jo pic mein Hai wesa bikul bhi nai tha baqvas suit tha.
"I placed my order for the first time on Laam.To be honest, there were doubts about the items that I will get the best results or not.Everyone knows that on websites,things/items seems much appealing and beautiful. To my surprise,I got clothes exactly as they are shown on the website.There colours,size and even the material is exactly as mentioned.There packaging was up to date.I highly recommend LAAM.It is a trustworthy platform üëå A***"
"The stuff is really great and the article itself is amazing, best experience ever üòç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
I Oder Maria b dress they send other brand . This website is fake .
Very poor customer support. From 4 days i am  trying but no response. I don‚Äôt know all phones lines are closed. Just replying hello on whatsapp. I placed order 4 days ago still my order is pending. I sent them payment slip. I think laam is no more. Order no 1236682.
I‚Äôm an extremely satisfied client of Laam . Each time I get my order and deliveries before committed date. My tip is to use some cheap service for delivery as delivery get expensive . Thank you Laam Keep up the good work
Worst fabric worst pls ladies don't fall from them  it's a big scan and cheaters. Worst dresses Worst stitching  you ll loose all your money
The quality of the product is really good
BUYER BEWARE!Their site will reject your order but they will still take the money out of your card!EXTREMELY shady website and billing practices!!STAY AWAY FROM THIS STORE!
"Laam is the worst, if you can go somewhere else to buy, you should. Ordered in December 2023 for my wedding in may. when placing order, they estimated delivery some time in march. March ends they tell me there is delay April 20 ship for sure, its April 20 one of the two dress shipped other one says delay. The customer service people are not even responding.  They are ruining my wedding. Just opinion if you cannot finish a simple dress in 4 plus months, why are you in business. For anyone that is reading this, if you have event dont order  from this company. They will just give you stress."
I loved the quality of clothes and fast delivery.
thanks laam for cooperating with me your staff is amazing and very supportive
Mera ya 4th order ha laam sy .i m soo much satisfied for laam services .
I am a regular buyer and i have been never disappointed from laam although i had one issue which is not yet resolved one of my dress I haven‚Äôt received and courier company as well as laam customer service couldn‚Äôt do anything i had only this issue otherwise one of the best online shopping site i can trust for my dress .Thank you laam.
"As a first-time shopper at LAAM, I must admit I was quite hesitant. However, I decided to take a chance, and I'm glad I did! I ordered eid dresses for my family  and the entire process exceeded my expectations.Order came on time and everything is exactly as shown on website.I would recommend Laam to anyone looking to buy clothes online.Thank you Laam."
I really like Laam services are too good and prompt always reply my queries on whatsapp and email dress are same as pic.Satisfied
I was very worried when I was ordering because I got scammed many time.this is first time I have ordered from LAAM.and I am very happy to received my order on time.service is very good and clothes are also very nice and quality material.i love this app.i will order again on next eid InshaAllah.
"I bought first time using Laam. I was scared about quality and looks. It turned out to be wrong. I got the stuff that I ordered and quality is also good. Delivery was 1 day late. I got it on Eid day evening. I ordered earlier. So, if you want to order before any specific event date, I will suggest to order way earlier. laam also provide parcel tracking website. I will recommend it."
"I paid for 5 orders via bank transfer and sent them the proof of payment on whatsapp. They didn‚Äôt respond for 2 weeks, then i started chasing them- the whatsapp team still hasn‚Äôt responded over 6 weeks later. The person helping me via their email is super slow and incompetent, he messed up the order numbers and the proof if payments, canceled some orders and without a refund (i had paid everything separately via bank transfer) its been 8 weeks since this mess has started and even though a customer service rep emailed me separately saying that she‚Äôll look into this , she has not responded in over 2 weeks. I am still awaiting orders to be fulfilled and for my refunds. Also they refuse to put me in touch with a manager. Idk what kind if sham lasm has become because i used to exclusively buy from them. Not anymore."
"Products are great for the price. Delivery charges are vert high and there is customs fee for shipment to canada. If that was not there or was lower, it would have the best platform for ethnic wears"
First experience with Laam and it was really good. The dress was really beautiful and upto the mark quality. No complaints.
All purchase from laamIs extremely goodIam so happy
The dress was absolutely similar to the picture. It came within the time frame. It was really good service. I will buy again from them.
Laam is the best place to shop ‚Ä¶ I love the style and the design colors and price. Specially with $25 flat shipping
"Overall a great experience for first time , quality was very good for the price and timely delivery and communication , will order again"
It's my first experience with laam and it is great one.The quality of product is very good as well as their delivery service is also very efficient.
"I order recently from laam the fabric quality was beyond my expectations, but the cons of laam is that i got my parcel late when i complaint about their service on their insta page they deleted my comment i don‚Äôt know why."
Awesome service. Delivered on time.
"My experience with Laam was really good. I have ordered from Laam few time now,The quality of clothing is matching with description, same as pictures shown on page. Most important is delivery is always on time..Also Good customer service üëç"
I ordered mine and my family clothes for Eid. Guess what! My parcel didn't arrive on eid and we had no other choice than to wear our old clothes on eid! The clothes were very bad quality and the sizes were so huge!So disappointed by laam customer service and quality of clothes! Thanks laam for ruining our eid!
"Wide variety of options for all ages and tastes. Quality of products is good, never disappointed. Prices are affordable for the products, in fact I have never paid such low prices for such beautiful outfits. Customer service is excellent. Overall LAAM is now my go to site for all online shopping.Offering a low flat rate for international shipping was so appreciated and motivated us to buy more."
Quality is best and delivery was very fast. Been ordering from Laam for so many years never failed.
The dress was amazing & beautiful as shown. It was worth buying
"My experience is good, services n the items r up to the mark"
Order arrived timely(before eid) and products were of good quality same as pictures.
My experience with Laam was good. The stuff n product matches with picture. Most important it's always on time.
Very nice and lovely dresses
"Great choices and prices, the clothes run true to size and quick delivery. Thank you!"
"Order arrived on time , I am happy with the quality of all the fabrics , sizes were accurate, packaging was good, I got Eid card too, I am satisfied overall,"
Laam customer service is outstanding it was my 3rd order my experience with laam is excellent.The delivery service is fast and the products are authentic
Laam is committed to satisfy it's customers. You can trust laam for shopping at your door step.
I ordered my dress from LAAM and it was exactly the same as displayed on the website. I loved the fabric and the stitching. Their customer service and delivery timings were excellent.
"My order always comes on time! Website needs some bug fixes and UX could be better, but the quality of my clothes have always been perfect!"
I ordered a mens kurta and trouser in Blue colour when delivered it was black colour completely different design and one piece no trouser. I was so disappointed and keep contacting them via WhatsApp but no luck they are not very good to reply customers!!!Its so waste of money. How can you parcel without trouser when you charge for it? A BIG DISSAPOINTMENT
I am so angry with laam. I ordered my nikkah outfit 2nd of Jan and asked them 100 times will this come in time for my nikkah. They assured me it would so I ordered. Yesterday i recieved and email saying its delayed they haven‚Äôt recieved it from Faiza saqlain but gave no update on when they will receive. I had to email and message 100 times on whatsapp and noor replied saying they recieved it late from Faiza saqlain and they will ship today. I woke up today still no shipping email why lie about it and ruin someone‚Äôs nikkah? I‚Äôve been messaging all day no reply at all. They do not care about ruining customers events and I am so angry at their service. My order number is Your order number is LAAM-1039787. I am so so angry and upset with them as they are not responding at all now and have ruined my nikkah. They need to provide me with full refund asap as I am so disgusted by their service especially during Ramadan???!!!!
Im waiting desperately for anyone from the LAAM team to atleast respond to my messages on Whatsapp and email as well..!! My order number is #1206924 i have placed the order for 4 dresses...i have sent many messages on Whatsapp and also emailed them twice and also contacted the team on Instagram but complete no response!! IN SHA ALLAH...i want my dresses before Eid...IN SHA ALLAH...!! On the website it just says processing the delivery date isn't mentioned at all!! I have ordered twice before with LAAM and it was a great experience as compared to this time...as they aren't replying to messages on any platform!! Please i need a response from the team!! Can the dresses be delivered in Riyadh before Eid?? Please reply!!
"I was supposed to receive my bridal dresses in March, it‚Äôs April and Laam hasn‚Äôt replied to me on WhatsApp for almost 3 weeks now. Nobody has responded to emails either, ridiculous. Order #1023771, kindly respond."
"I am tired of this brand, I ordered three items after I put my review in laam, they said one of them is delayed u can cancel if needed and rest will be send in two days. I cancelled and got my payment back for the cancelled order, but the other two still didn't come no reply at all, from customer care. The wats app is automatic generated answers not replying what I am asking. I am so stressed because of my orders in laam.please send my rest of the money if you can't deliver before eid three weeks has gone still not delivered"
I really like this dress same as picture  really nice and comfortable and the colour is very beautiful üòç‚ù§Ô∏è
"I recently ordered from Laam Pak, and while my overall experience had some challenges, I appreciate their efforts in resolving the issues. My parcel took longer than expected to arrive, and I faced difficulties with delivery, requiring multiple emails and follow-ups. However, I was eventually able to pick up my package.The dresses I received were beautiful and of good quality, but unfortunately, one dupatta had a hole, which was disappointing. Given the long process and the minor defect, I expected a smoother experience. I hope Laam Pak improves its delivery service and quality checks in the future.That said, I do appreciate their customer service for responding to my emails. With some improvements, I believe they can provide a much better shopping experience."
My experience was amazing üò≠‚ù§Ô∏èi am in love with the dresses And i will send u guys aa video make sure to upload it on your page‚ù§Ô∏èüòò
I needed the dress for a party on 27 feb urgently but I am glad the delivery of my order was on time on 21 feb and the product was also more than just perfect.
"I had an amazing experience shopping from laam Pakistan.The dress I ordered exceeded my expectations‚Äîit was exactly as shown in the pictures, with good quality fabric, perfect stitching, and a super comfortable fit.The delivery was fast, and the packaging was secure.If you‚Äôre looking for stylish, high-quality outfits with a seamless shopping experience, this is the place to shop! I‚Äôll definitely be coming back for more. Highly recommended! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
I really like the site but I asked for help and was not helpedI wanted to have order confirmation for customs clearance they didn't help me I don't know how to get it they have no reasonable way to solve a problem the robot does not help me probably my order will be returned
"Laam amazed me with their delivery process,love everything i ordered.the quality,size,and value for money....for sure ordering frm thm again n again. Im almost sorted for ramadan and Eid. Thank you once again LAAM."
Same as shown
Very low quality stuff. I can't give review less than 1 star.
Always Bestest experience Alhumdulilah‚ô•Ô∏è
"Replica, only emails no original contact numbers, fake id .Stole your money on the name of original and they didn‚Äôt return your money"
I absolutely loved it. Delivery was so on time. Thanks to Laam
"Found them unprofessional, no cordination between customer and courier setvices. I ordered for the first time after checking express shipping assuming it to be expressed delivery which is misguided marketing strategy. After wait of 8 business days I kept on inquiring about my order as no update on courier service was shown after reaching to Karachi. It is an international order ( 8 dresses) with custom duty payment. After 13 business days they told me my ordered was returned back  to them due to an unexpected error. Now they are asking me if I want them that would again take 10 to 14 days. Why not express delivery then. I asked for my refund and now no  response from their end. Very much worried. Feeling scammed and at loss."
Big scammers. Wrong dresses sizes. Bad stitching .i ordered xl appears as small. Now  refused to refund my money.so frustrating.they should be banned for online purchasing.i am still surprised with their customer service!
"Fast delivery, great products"
What worse shipment I Oder my dresses in 15 January and today is 3 February and still there is no update
"Ordered several times, its hit and miss! Sometimes we are delighted with our order, we have also  been very disappointed especially after waiting several weeks for the delivery only to receive faulty or sub standard quality. They need to improve their quality control as well as the customer service."
"I‚Äôll try to be fair with the positives and negatives.First order - supposedly eligible for next day dispatch. Waited some time before asking for an update and was told sorry, and to wait 3-4 more working days. Again still wasn‚Äôt dispatched so I cancelled that order. I was refunded in full, and received the money back in my account several days later. No problem here very smooth and easy. Second order - also eligible for next day dispatch, and I actually did get the tracking the next day! It was a weekend so the parcel started moving on the upcoming Monday and was received in London 3 days later. Fantastic turnaround time. Shipping was free as it was over ¬£100 and I was not charged customs fees when it landed in the UK.Unfortunately the stitching was very poor for a suit of that value (Gulaal brand - suit was ¬£160) and it was made with a different lining style that totally altered the look of the suit. I‚Äôm flexible and generally not overly fussy, I don‚Äôt expect total perfection at any price point but this was really below acceptable at that kind of value. I‚Äôve bought suits less than half this price from elsewhere that have been completed to a much higher standard. The initial response from Laam has been disappointing, claiming the issues are just ‚Äúloose threads that can be cut off‚Äù despite clear images showing the nature of the issues - several unfinished hems, visible messy freehand stitching that is integral to the structure so would fall apart if cut, excess fabric not trimmed from inside the sheer sleeves making a bulky, unfinished look. I would like to keep it, to be honest it‚Äôs too close to an event to get a replacement anyway. I can leave it with a tailor overnight to correct the stitching issues and possibility even change the lining style issue but so far Laam‚Äôs offer of a 10% refund is not going to cover that cost. Let‚Äôs see. They seem responsive on whatsapp, so I will also give them credit for that. Final update - after more detailed photos they agreed to my proposition of a 25% refund. I‚Äôm satisfied. Overall I will give 4 stars, as I accept that they‚Äôre a 3rd party platform so rely on the various brands they source from to stitch things well. It also impacts them as well as the customer if the brand do not stitch items satisfactorily. My suggestion however would be to implement quality control before forwarding items on to the customer, especially on more expensive pieces. Thank you"
I orderd a suit . Suit is much better.  issue is that dupata is too short so i am diappoineted.
Worst dresses. Their quality is bad and not near to pictures. This should be called a scam store. Thanks
"Waiting for my order LAAM-1126435, placed order on 27th feb, was told will be dispatched on 30th March. No order no update no reply to my emails. Don‚Äôt know if I will get by eid as no one replies to emails"
I have received my order today. I was worried about the product authenticity. I received the original brand product!! Which they have been stated that they sell original brand products. Good thing is I received my dresses before Eid!! Thanks Laam! Last week you guys assured me that once you receive the product from the brand you will dispatch my order. And you did it!! Appreciated.
Good experience Thanks laam
Currently waiting for update on my 3 orders which were all guaranteed delivery before Eid.. Order numbers 1124752 11151991115243
ordered on the 10th March. After persistent messages and emails i was told the item is ready to be shipped on 26th March within 24 hours. Still waiting for an update.order 1155641
üëç it was good experience
Excellent service e commerce pakistan
Delay in orderI ordered on 28th Feb from Dubai and till now didn't receive any response nor reply from Customer Service in-spite of multiple calls to call centre i ordered to wear it on eid but the status shows still processing i am traveling to my country on 3 apr from uae i request to deliver it before that plz don‚Äôt spoil my eid
"first of all the customer care is the worst they dont even bother to ans your questions and they just give automated repliesworrrsssttt websiteinspite of taking the money they dont even deliver properly on time i wanted the dress for eid and asking them 100 times will they deliver it before eid they send automated repliesdont order from this stupid website its a scamthey are just fooling people and then later on they say we will refund the amount worst worst worst websiteno proper customer service , no delivery on time and woorrrsssttt website that i came across in my life"
"Really really poor customer service, i ordered from¬†laam.pk¬†on 03/18 it was saira shakira 3 piece outfit which i really liked, received the outfit trouser red color stains on it, right a way called laam many times also email them in order to resolve this issue, but they didnt respond until 3 or 4 days, representative Zainab sends me email to address my issue again, i emailed her back telling my issue no response until 3 days, my original request was replacing the outfit with new piece as i loved the outfit couldn't wear due to stains or offer me another article as replacement, but i received the email from another representative Muhammed today filling out the return form, i mean i didnt request to return the item at first i am asking the simple request fix the same item or send new piece or give me options of different article if any of these doesnt work out i am happy to return the item, they dont care what customer is requesting, very very pathetic customer service."
"I have ordered for the first time from LAAM, and I hope I receive the products on time, i.e., before Eid. I was really in two minds. The order is to be delivered to Germany, and I shall write again after receiving the products so that people from Germany can read them and decide whether they want to buy from here or not. I will later compare the products I ordered (see on the website) to what I receive(hopefully).  P.S: The website needs some bug fixes.Update: The parcel arrived on 04.04.24.It was delivered through FedEx. Zoll charged me 25 Euros, which I paid online on the FedEx website.The parcel came in intact on a pretty rainy day.As far as LAAM, the website goes, it did its job.No complaints here!Coming to the products and quality.I have a lot to say.To begin with, it's not the best.My daughter's suits were from good to okay. The front ribbon fastening started shredding in 10 minutes. I washed the suits, and thankfully the colour didn't bleed.My suits were below average, and the work was very, very shaudy. One suit had the stones stuck with the worst glue on planet Earth. I was leaving a trail behind as I wore it. I dipped it once in water, and lo and behold, the bathtub was filled with sequins. I wish I could share a photograph. (Heartbreak). It did bleed a bit pink, but that's not even a thing because the dress is not wearable anymore. Do not expect any threadwork. Everything is stuck and of inferior quality. I feel cheated.The other one was okay. I will not be washing it any time soon, and I won't even invest in dry cleaning it at Textilpflege. Henceforth, I shall wear loads and loads of deodorant.In short, LAAM is trustworthy as a third party delivering close-to-photograph products.What you see is not what you get!It's more like you will get a second copy of the original product design and description."
"I am really shocked to see that I got no response from their what'sapp number , I tried so many times then I emailed them still no response and then my brother in Pakistan called them and he said their number is not working and I bought my abayas on 16th march and still waiting for delivery... ( its eid now and I m still waiting for one of my abayas) now they said it will deliver after 25 April  ...I don't know what to say"
"Very bad customer service. Total disappointment. Laam didn't reply to email or via WhatsApp. The date on the item is available to deliver before Eid. After the purchase, the delivery date on the invoice is in May. I am very disappointed, and the charge will be deputed."
"Please contact ASAP. I need my outfits to be delivered to the US before Eid. My order # is 1181014. On the website it said it would arrive before Eid. If it does not arrive, please kindly cancel the order. Thank you."
Do you have to pay custom duty on all UK orders after laam charges you delivery cost?
"This is my first time ordering into Laam. I placed an order a week ago but I still did not receive any update, even though they are not responding to WhatsApp texts and emails. It is really frustrating. I paid the full amount and I don‚Äôt have any clue if I received the item or not I know you guys are busy on Eid, but you should respond to customer inquiries, and sorry to say your customer service is really bad."
For the price the quality is very bad and then i call on mention number but no response for return productüò°üò°
Ordered on 27th feb i placed the order They showed delivered will be by the end of march Later on they started showing one item delivery is lateSo I modified my cart on 11th march and made some extra paymentLater they promised that it will be shipped in 48 hrs by 13 th march i will be getting the consignment numberNow after payment and everything its been 15 days no response from them and daily they will change one one item showing it as delayed
"I ordered around 9 to 10 dresses from Laam. Amount wise it was a significant order. I live in Sharjah, UAE.However, I have received wrong sizes for 3 of my dresses. My order number is 1137314I ordered 3 pieces of this particular brand dress.2 sizes of S and one LIn the product description size chart on laam website, for S it was mentioned 25inch bust size but what I have received is only 19inch. For L it is mentioned 27inch but what I have received is 22 inch.One S size dress is completely different color and material, and size issue stays the same. Chest size is 19. Not 25 as mentioned.I have dropped multiple whatsapp messages and emails at customercare at laam.pk, but no response. No one picks up the call also. This is a desperate try to get a response from the team.Kindly guide me how to return this product back. Please issue a refund of this as soon as possible. The amount is 200 aed +Need laam team to kindly revert. I have photos and also screenshot of then size chart displayed for me as well."
Ive been trying get the n touch with team but no one is responding
Worst customer service and delayed orders with no information on it .. untrustworthy
Great service. Products were true to description and good quality.
"My order number is # 1182497I have ordered this on 20th of march 2024 it was supposed to be shipped on 22nd of march and I am supposed to receive this before eid and my order is big‚Ä¶i have ordered 24 suits and i paid $1400 canadian which convert to PKR 275,121.73 and i haven‚Äôt got any update on my delivery‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt track my order‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt reach to theses people..i am calling them they don‚Äôt answer..trying to email them they don‚Äôt response..!

While taking the order they are happy but after that they don‚Äôt care to reply you back‚Ä¶!"
Laam customer service is excellent they sent parcel on time . I had some color issue they refund my amount with delivery charges
My outfit still hasn‚Äôt been despatched! I placed it on time and now it says delay. I would not have paid for delivery nor placed an order if it wasn‚Äôt going to come in time! I need it a few days before eid. I have contacted LAAM so many times on WhatsApp and emails but have had no reply!! Order number 1179021
"Ive placed an order on 21 March and the items were supposed to be shipped on the 22 March. However, in my profile, its still showing in progress and delayed! Ive tried to reach customer service via email and whatsapp, but no response!! Very disappointing.. I badly need an update at the earliest.. order number ; 1183701"
What had happened was that i purchased clothes back on January 25th and was told that the estimated shipping dats for my stuff would be march 1st it is MARCH 23rd and still have not received my order i ordered these ahead of time for eid i keep contacting them via email and whatsapp no one is responding to anything they literally dont care i keep calling their number and no one is picking up my calls its super frustrating to me that now first off i have no eid clothes and second im given wrong shipping dates i need these clothes to me by april 5th ALL FOUR OF MY ITEMS i am entitled to this order because i payed for it order number:1069693
I have been waiting for my order since 10/03 it stated it would arrive before eid. Noone has responded to via email or whatsapMy order is Order #: 1157003 can you respond to me please laam
Placed an order in January. Been informed delayed twice. Was meant to be dispatched on 14th March no response to my messages or email.Another order havent even been informed it is delayed but not received. Need to improve their customer service.
"Order 1165023. After I wrote a negative review on this platform, I finally got a response from Laam. The response on my review suggests that the items have been dispatched on 15th of March and tracking ID had been sent to my email, even though I had not received anything. Then later on I got a response to all my emails that I had previously sent suggesting all my items will be dispatched on the 4th of April. I appreciated the fact that they finally responded to my emails but they still didn't help. On one side they are saying they dispatched the items on the 15th of March and privately they are telling me they will be dispatching on the 4th of April. I responded to their email with a possible solution of splitting my order and  can pay extra for another delivery and now they are not responding again. I understand that its a busy season and it must be hard to respond to all emails but then brands such as Laam need to prepare for such email traffic. Also, they have no number I can call and talk to someone. I am still hoping I get my items in time for Eid."
"This was my second time i ordered from LAAM, my first experience was really good, on time shipping and delivery within 1 week. But now when i placed an order second time on 5th March, it was mentioned EID delivery and i ordered 2 dresses. So on 19th March i received an email that 1 of the dress would be  delayed and shipped after 21st May, i mean like seriously. And i have no idea about my 2nd second dress. So after sending alot of emails and messages on whatsapp, they replied in a short message that if i want my other dress to be delivered, i have to cancel the order of the delayed dress. So, i canceled the order for the delayed dress and now i have no idea about the other dress that it will be delivered before EID or not.They don't have any tracking information. They don't reply to anybody messages.. This is not how someone run a business or an online platform.. We are residing abroad and we really wish to wear Pakistani brands which are not easily available here. That's why we order from these platforms, and now it's really frustrating when nobody takes the initiative to reply or at least deliver the product on time..My order no.: 1146076, 1 item: Malhaar SV3654.Kindly assist if someone from LAAM is there."
"I ordered a $1300 dress from Laam and had a terrible experience. I wish I had paid $20 more and ordered directly from the brand. They failed to follow instructions I gave them and then I had to go back and forth get it fixed. I told them specifically that the dress shouldn‚Äôt be see through from anywhere, and they ended making a hole in the back and see through sleeves. I asked them to fix it and they refused, then after going back and forth for a week, i told them i will be disputing charges and they started taking me seriously and connected me to a case manager. They said they will take care it and tried to cover the hole by adding a piece of cloth underneath which wasn‚Äôt perfect but it worked and I was okay with it. I received my dress and measurements were off and it had a small black mark which I couldn‚Äôt remove but due to my previous experience I didn‚Äôt bother contacting them and I thought to myself that I will just try to get the measurements fixed from someone here. But then a month later I received a 64 dollar bill from fedex for shipping and I had already paid the same amount to LAAM for shipping. I contacted them and they presented me with some policy about custom fees that Laam isn‚Äôt responsible for to cover themselves. I have ordered from so many brands from so many different countries and have never received a bill from fedex for shipping. And I honestly don‚Äôt believe that it is a coincidence that I paid them 64 dollars for shipping and then I receive a bill for the same amount. I recommend saving your energy and ordering directly from the brand. I had ordered this dress for a special occasion and I have so many bad memories with it and I will never be ordering from Laam again!"
I have been ordering from Laam for years now and never had issues. Early Feb I placed an order which was supposed to ship 3/2. I have been trying to reach customer service for days now no response. Today I received an automated response in what‚Äôs app telling my my dresses have not shipped as they are still waiting on designers. I asked which outfits are they waiting on ‚Ä¶no response. My Order #: 1089540. I need this before Eid and I‚Äôm very disappointed with how the service has been. It‚Äôs very frustrating
Both suites were same as the pictures which is now getting rare and both are very pretty.
Products are original and high quality. I am highly satisfied
Excellent customer serviceüëçüèªüëçüèªShop again InshaAllah‚ù§Ô∏è
I wanted to make a return and requested refund. Ms. Ammara understood my concern and guide me through the process. She was cooperative and polite in all her correspondence. I received the refund before time and look forward to more purchase with LAAM.
"Recently i made an order from LAAM and when i got the parcel, it amazed me with its presence, i mean it was even more beautiful than i expected and it will be unfair if I don‚Äôt mention the fact of their good services.Thank you Team Laam"
"They are liars and cheaters. Marketing 40% on shipping to usa for eid special. The standard charge is 30,000 rs for 13lbs so the 40% should be off on that but they increased shipping to 88,000 rs and after 40% off brought it back down to 30,000. I am very well aware that my package wont even be more than 10lbs which is 20,000 rs. On top charging hefty amount of tax"
Super co-operative staff with good service. Keep flourishing.
I had an issue with the product that I bought from Laam for which I contacted their customer service and I‚Äôm impressed by the quality of their service and how they helped me to sort out the issue in the best possible way. Ammara was the customer service representative who dealt with this and she was extremely professional and helpful.
Excellent service too good quality of all products.  I am doing shopping üõç from long time most trusted way of online shopping. Thanks alot laamüíñ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
"No one responds neither on whatsapp nor instagram! First i ordered a dress and they cancelled my order after 45 days. Then i ordered again and they sent me a wrong dress. When i am complaining about it that i wanna return that dress and i want what i ordered, no one bothers to respond or resolve a problem! Totally rubbish!"
My experience with laam very good always dress Same as description and quite so good I buy then more then 10 times and they services very good delivery too fast and always answer in whatsaap too and iam satisfied and buy more more
"One of the best apparel studio so far ... 100%satisfied, will shop again üëç"
‚ÄúI have recently placed 5 orders with around 20 outfits with Laam. my experience has been absolutely amazing. My msgs and queries have been dealt with very promptly in a polite and professional manner Laam team have kept me updated about my orders from purchase to shipping. I was a bit worried after reading some bad reviews especially as I also live in the UK but I can honestly say Laam has a remarkable customer service they put so much effort in giving you the best online shopping experience. All my outfits have been delivered on the scheduled time and are exactly as described all genuine articles every outfit is absolutely beautiful.  Laam is definitely my go to online shop now. Thankyou so much to all the laam team :)‚Äù
Really amazing product .Highly recommended ‚úÖ
"The cloth I received was fake, I bought a cloth for $50 and it took so long to come, once I received it I check it out and something was up with it, the material was terrible and was nothing like it said in the description, I recommend you guys to not buy from these guys. Just a heads up they never return your clothing and their customer service is rubbish!"
"An amazing website with lots of options always‚Ä¶ extremely cooperative staff‚Ä¶happened with me when I wasnt happy with the purchase once and i returned and got fill refund‚Ä¶have shopped from this site multiple times and loved the service, the quality and the speed‚Ä¶always.Highly Highly recommended. üëçüëçüëç"

The company is great with great customer service. I have ordered over 20 dresses from this link in just one year. They have quality clothes. Highly recommend this site!
"I had ordered a suit to the UK. It said a specific date for shipping. This is still not shipped and it is past that day. They are saying that the brand has not given them the item, however, this is not fair on me. LAAM should be chasing the brand. LAAM completely forgot about my order until I had queried. LAAM is not helping me. They are not responding to chats neither picking up the phone on instagram."
"Edit: i have now opened a case against them with my bank. This is a nightmare for international buyers. Absolutely horrible website. I ordered from Laam.pk and received absolute garbage for clothes! While I filed for return along with proof of the terrible clothes they sent me, they proceeded to negotiate 50% return saying they are a third party and send clothes to us as received from the original vendor. I don't understand why there is negotiation.  The clothes are nothing as described on the website!! Hence they should return the customer the money. An absolute scam.  I've lost 100s of dollars.  You are better of ordering from the actual vendor and not the third party website such as Laam. Very disappointing. They don't even have the option of reviews on their website for clothes!!! This is how they scam their customers. You have to blindly trust that the product is great and buy it and then they proceed to only give 50% or even less Back. I am not going to take the 50% I need all my money back for the terrible clothes they sent me."
"This company struggles to serve their international customers, specifically, US and Canada. They do not have a number that US/Canada customers can call. I tried calling the number listed here on trust pilot, but it will not go through. The responses on whatsapp chat are superficial and very generic, it does not seem that they care to resolve any issues nor do they have a sense of urgency. Also, they charge approximately $30-40 shipping PER ITEM. For example, based on today's exchange rate, the first item may have approximately  $39 charge for shipping to the US, and second may add  $33 charge for shipping, and third item may add $30 charge for shipping. Some thing about this seems very wrong especially when we went to the designer's website and can order same items directly from there for a flat rate of about $50 instead of $100+ shipping.Overall, my disappointment is with their customer service and lack of support for US/Canada customers."
My experience is so good I really like the stuff üå∏üòçüòç
Love itDress my daughter loves a lot But I want in xs small size n xxl size which u don't haveI really appreciate if u Start making xs size xxl size
My experience was good.. delivery on time ..
"The price range and sale on the website for year end was fabulous. I found many designs that I really liked. Most importantly very few sites gives a generous XL/L. All sizes are available with gorgeous options on embroidered, colors and materials from silk to Chiffon. The team shipped my items promptly and on time. I will buy again and recommend the site for US buyers. Safe portal , easy transaction using credit card."
I had an issue with my order and I wanted my refund. It took a little more than 2 months but eventually I received the amount that I lost.
I‚Äôm really satisfied with my purchase and the dress was so reasonable in this price tag. Got exactly what was shown in picture
"I liked that we can buy different brands but the photos are not totally accurate to the clothing. And the fabric you cannot tell at all. I said one yellow gown and it is such a polyester gown that I can‚Äôt believe it can look like the photo. If you‚Äôre going to send me pictures of the dresses on the website, it would be useful to have the actual dress on the photo too, not just the stock photo with good lighting and models etc."
"I bought a few clothes and this was not the first time however was the first time when I wanted to exchange/return. Usually, when you contact their customer service for non-return related issues they will respond within 24hrs even though the responses are usually very standard and feels like they don't really understand your question however it wasn't a major issue so I ignored them. But this time with the return/exchange email, they didn't respond at all and when I contacted them on whats app I was told that the emails were not received. What a lie! the same email address I have previously emailed on and they all were received but this time very conveniently was not received!? I still have not managed to get through to them after that! Dealing with their customer support is a complete nightmare. And specially if it's an international delivery, THEY WILL IGNORE YOU! Honestly, I would never shop with them again. And I would not recommend them at all!"
"They are not trust worthy at all. My family and I ordered many different suits seperately. All the suits my family ordered were really bad quality with stitching not close to the picture. They had my suit in stock when I ordered but then went out of stock and didn't tell me. I ordered back in October and it is now January. They delayed my order so much that everything else I ordered also went out of stock. Dealing with their customer service was terrible. They did nothing to help us. We said how many suits in the order and they would tell us the shipping address. They literally were useless. I ordered six suits in one of my orders. They emailed us months later saying they shipped two. When it come and we had to pay duties, the duties were way too high for only two suits. We emailed them back and forth and it took them three days to figure out they actually sent us four suits and not two like the shipping confirmation said. We didn't know if we could trust it but we paid the duties and the dresses came. The dresses were way too big even though it is meant to be fitted. I am a size small exactly but this dress was sewed like it was for someone who is large. We want to cancel the two remaining suits from our order which didn't ship and they aren't letting us even though they still have it and haven't sent it out yet. My family and I have spent over $3000 together and over half of what we ordered is unusable. Never order from them. I got lucky with two of my suits out of ten I ordered. Money down the drain"
Beautiful dresses and on time delivery
"as i expected, sooo lovely ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Online shopping is very risky because u don't know what u see will be the same thing that you are going to receive but i had an Amazing experience with LAAM.As they make sure that we are receiving the high quality products.And there customer service is superb.Highly satisfiedAlways will be my 1st priority for online shopping.
So glad that Laam was my first stop  for my wedding dresses shopping !. It was a intimate experience that totally alleviated all the stress i had about my wedding dress collection .Laam has great selection and variety of dresses.amazing price too these sales ü§≠! I would like to buy more dresses for my collection InshaaAllah ‚ù§Dr Amna Noman
It was a great experience with laam...I was little bit nervous but after reaching my order I'm 100% satisfied!! In shaa Allah I'll shop again from Laam & I also highly recommended to other..Thank you Laam!!
Hy Laam.. I'm happy. Very beautiful outfit you send me. My first experience with you.Shop again Inshallah
"The experience with Laam was really great. At first I felt kinda nervous about the whole shipping process and the quality as I ordered from Australia. But the reviews really helped me through. The quality was absolutely amazing, the dress was as it is shown and the shipping process was so fast. I got my dress within 4 working days. I would really recommend Laam and if anyone has any concerns about anything please check the reviews before ordering. It really helped me."
"On time delivery and authentic brands are the keys to laam experience. I can now blinding trust laam, and I have recommended it and will recommend to my family and friends ‚ù§Ô∏è keep growing"
"EDIT response to the reply: I understand being a third party seller, how come every time you delay it I‚Äôm told ‚Äúxxx is the new delivery date‚Äù. Who is providing that confirmation?? Why are you giving false dates or deceiving customers without knowing the actual information yourself?! Absolutely BS excuses. Absolutely horrible customer service! I ordered an outfit in October and they had delayed it 3 times (until now) and now they‚Äôre telling me they‚Äôre still unable to deliver my outfit. The order is paid in full. They offer to provide a refund by doing conversions which results in me loosing money because of something that their fault. They claim to have USD banking account so no idea why they can‚Äôt refund full amount in dollars. All they do is apologize and keep delaying the outfits."
The dress came to me safely and perfectly nothing to complain and the sale was a huge benefit for me since it's wedding season
Oh wow‚Ä¶.I just got the package from LAAMIt‚Äôs beyond amazing and way beyond my expectations!!!Thank you so much‚Ä¶.Love my clothes.Lovely‚Ä¶
Hamza my assistant at laam was a great help answering my queries and keeping me upto date with my order. The order itself was made beautifully. Very satisfied. Thank you Laam
I ordered waist coat online and received damaged item.tried to call helpline but no response.please never buy from this fraudulent company.
"Poor customer care service: I placed an order, made the payment, but haven't received any updates. There's been no response on WhatsApp, and despite trying to call for the past five days, no one is picking up."
I am in love with this outfit. Beautiful and excellent quality.
Trouser were changed as shown in picture.Please take notice..if designing will not match then how it is possible to place order 2nd time
I loveee your services. Providing your customers with such great quality. It‚Äôs always a treat ordering from you guys. Keep up with the good work üëçüèª
excellent clothes. on time delivery.
"Laam platform provides it's customers with the best and ensures timely delivery. Also, the complaints and customer care support is highly efficient in their work. No doubts in the genuinety."
I am really grateful to Laam for helping me in returning and changing the dress. Will surely shop again In Sha Allah ü•∞ü•∞
"Incredible, not just products the people working with laam....thank God I found a place that is completely different than other frauds...."
My experience with laam is always great. Communication is excellent. Having Very responsible staff to reply every email and resolve problems according order. Keep it.
Such a great experience with Laam.pk ... Ordered twice from them and everything was up to the mark both the times. 100% satisfied üòÜ
"The quality was absolutely perfect, i loved the outfit, will definitely order again"
"Very helpful team, great communication."
It's my 1st  order it‚Äôs very fantastic & fast delivery thank you so much laam team üòç
Received my order timely. It was beautiful as advertised.
The customer service is extremely helpful. Great work!
"I am trying to communicate with the customer service from last Saturday.. it's a week now.. all they are telling me is the partial order will be shipped in 24 hrs, I will get tracking ID to track order Upto doorstep on Ur email, it will take 4-6 days for international orders to be delivered..Are 24 hrs as long as 6 days?????My estimated shipping date was 15th Dec, 2 dresses were late so I asked them to sent the rest, they agreed but nothing is done about it yet.. I am travelling out of the country of delivery which is Kuwait, on 31st Dec for a wedding for which I need the clothes.. You guys have peaked my anxiety levels to another high.. I have a wedding to attend on 3rd Jan and the order is for 3 people.. what will I do if the order doesn't reach on time.. you guys are just making me crazy.. I did a big mistake ordering from LAAM.. I am in literal tears while typing this.."
"Everytime i have placed an order after two months they cancel it and update as unavailable.Extremely horrible customer service.They never send orders, avoiding paying upfront as refund is another hassle of months."
RUN away !!! It is a scam. Dresses were so big and not the same as pictures. Don't waste your money. They said for refunds you have to contact within 48 hours for shipment arrival. I did. No refunds or returns are allowed on international orders was their response.
I receive my parcel Fully fully satisfiy stuff embroidery each nd everything
We have placed order to riyadh .. they have sent in different packages for so called faster delivery but all 7 packages are coming at same time with so much of extra charges on each package ... and also we had paid shipping charging before hand and now the delivery partner says you have pay these charges which is more than 20 percent of the order fee f not it vl go back and laam has no customer service to respond asap niether any one to speak.. Is it a joke?? @ laam Is it our mistake to order n shed so much money on clothing with no response and clarification from your side
They have divided shipment into multiple packages and tax implied on single package upto 20 percentIt exceeds the value even of shipment by breaking into multiple packagesKindly respondNot responding to messages
"I had a terrible experience with LAAM on my first purchase, and I regret not reading reviews beforehand.They are dishonest and unethical. While I don‚Äôt want to generalize, my dealings with Pakistani businesses have often been disappointing. To summarize, I placed an international order with LAAM, where all items were to be shipped together. First, they delayed the ‚Äúexpress order‚Äù by more than 5 days. When I followed up, they blamed a quality check issue.I canceled a dress due to a change of mind and also canceled the delayed product holding up my order. The two cancellations were about 10 days apart. While I received a refund for the later cancellation, the refund for the earlier one‚Äînow pending for 2 months‚Äîis still missing.LAAM keeps telling me to check with my bank, which makes no sense. My bank confirmed they don‚Äôt block transactions, and I‚Äôve already received one refund from LAAM, so why not the other?This has been a terrible experience. LAAM‚Äôs business practices on an international platform are shady and unethical. Refund my money and have some accountability."
I ordered 2 items on Sunday which came very quickly. However one of the items has a tear on the main body. I emailed yesterday to ask for a replacement body piece but am still awaiting a response.
I am really happy to see my outfit üòÅ And fast delivery is so convenient Thank you so much Laam
"To be honest,I like the stitching ,the details but to me there is something that has to be improved and that is the cloth fabric."
Waiting for my order. No response from them.
i heat the this  app i want my  mony back give me my f mony
They didn‚Äôt deliver the dress at the expected delivery time but they did listen to my queries and make sure to deliver my dress as soon as possible and dress is no doubt very beautiful.Thank you
I have received my refund after 3 months of wait yes it was too frustrating but still I received it and as they have promised to work on their refund process
"I was sent wrong items, I went through the hassle of returning them. I had to pay for postage again even though it wasn‚Äôt my fault that the wrong items were sent. I requested to refund my payment and the postage charge. Laam did not pay the postage charge and my payment was short by ¬£4. Will never shop from Laam."
"Last week I going to purchase a few out fits from laam. When I  I went to check to make payment at the bottom it said to receive your goods you will have to pay VAT separate, which really put me off from putting my order through."
"Update: Don‚Äôt deal with them, they will send wrong order and don‚Äôt accept return, after replying to me by below response, I have contacted them and they said sorry we don‚Äôt accept returns again, they just reply by that to show people that they care."
"Extremely efficient service. I ordered an outfit from the Laam website, and received it less than a week later. The outfit was EXACTLY as pictured, and by the original designer, no replicas. This was my first time ordering from Laam, and I will be 100% ordering again."
LAAM delayed my order. Then delivered a clothing that looks nothing like the dress on the website. My item meets the criteria for a refund. But they‚Äôre rejecting it. Stay far away from this site. The customer service is terrible. They keep closing the chat when I ask for assistance. I would not recommend this site.
"Do not use this fraudulent company.  I ordered express shipping, was charged a high fee, not received my order by the date provided and no response via whatsapp and email."
There was a critical situation for delivery. Mr.Bilal handled it smoothly and made my experience wonderful with Laam! Customer care is quick to response and handle things smoothly!
"This was my second order from LAAM and it was disappointing. I had ordered 2 outfits and on delivery the courier service charged me excess fees which I paid at that moment in time. After calculating the amount of Vat I realized that there was a discrepancy and some excess amount paid. I wrote to LAAM customer care and asked them to share the breakdown of the delivery cost and was told that the amount for Vat and fees was total 23AED only, however I was charged Aed 73. I asked them to refund since the amount is overpaid. The skynet personnel called and said it was done erroneously by the driver and will be returned the next day. Since 3 weeks I have been following up from LAAM on the subject matter and they are not able to resolve and just giving me holding responses. If these charges were taken erroneously it needs to be refunded. Such practiced are disappointing and erode customer trust. I am still awaiting for my refund! I hope I can trust LAAM again and expect this matter resolved promptly."
the worst thing with Laam is they dont have the correct delivery date. They are mentioning only shipping date. We ordered many items from Laam on 15th Nov and not received items untill dec-03. Even the laam customer care has no idea about the shipping. They are keep on changing the dates. And their response also very slow. Usually they are replying after 1 day only.My order no-1491976
Hi I received a prince coat which I ordered for my son. They send me wrong size and then I am contacting them and there is no response. I emailed them and send messages at what‚Äôs app. Pathetic customer service. We have a wedding this week and I received that order nearly after a months. So disappointed Naseem akhter
"I recently bought a few outfits from Laam for myself, my daughter, and my husband. The quality is really good! I was a bit worried that the outfits might be different from what they showed in the pictures, but they were perfect! The sizes were perfect too. I'm really impressed with Laam. It's a great platform for people overseas who want to buy traditional outfits."
"Worst customer service in history. They didn‚Äôt send some of my items and when asked about it they said i have to let them know within 24 hours. They are checking with the brand about one of these items, but have refused to acknowledge the others as i didn‚Äôt let them know within 24hours of delivery.Ordered 27 items, most of which were very different from the pictures - quality, colour, embroidery and fabric wise. They will offer you 20-30% refund on 2-3 items and get on with their business. Customer satisfaction is not a thing at LAAM. Also, they take ages to reply and do not trust the customer at all.FRAUD! DO NOT ORDER."
Customer service is non existent it‚Äôs zero!So if you order something and have even a slight problem forget about it ever being resolved or listened to You‚Äôll always be in the dark as they don‚Äôt care about their customers
I recently ordered clothes for myself and my daughter. Estimated shipping date was later than expected. I contacted customer service via their WhatsApp and requested earlier shipping.Items were shipped overseas to us within the next fortnight.Only regret; should have ordered more items.
Fabric quality was very rough.not satisfied at all.over all very bad experience with this website.waste of money.
"After making us wait 5 weeks for 4 outfits they moved the dispatch date to another week , then without giving us an update with what is happening with the order they automatically issued us with a refund leaving us short notice to find outfits for my brothers nikkah !!!! Absolutely horrendous if h can‚Äôt meet demands don‚Äôt Take the orders !!!?"
"Just awful customer service. Our package was somehow miss handled by shipper and ended up with US Mail - Lost and Found. Product never reached us as US Mail post office said the mailing label had no funds, so package was hacked along the way. We been battling with LAAM for refund for 3 months now ???"
"Awful service from their side, bad customer service. Order was delivered with item missing however they did not care. Rude and robotic replies. Will never shop there again."
"I had worst experience - find my latest email to Laam belowDear LAAM Customer Support,I am writing to express my extreme frustration with the handling of my recent purchase and refund request. I made an order for 3 suits, which was confirmed at the time of purchase. However, shortly after, I was informed that you are a third-party application, and the vendor responsible for the suits would not be able to fulfill the order on time. As a result, I was forced to cancel the order.I paid for the items in advance, and was assured that the refund would be processed. Despite your acknowledgment of this request, I have still not received the refunded amount back on my credit card. It has now been over three weeks since I initially raised this issue, and despite multiple follow-ups with your customer support team, I am no closer to receiving my money.In my most recent interaction with your team, you provided a payment proof, but stated that the refund has been processed on your end. However, this has not been reflected on my credit card, nor has my bank acknowledged any refund. It is clear that there has been an issue with the transaction, and I find it unacceptable that your customer support is now asking me to ""check at my end,"" rather than taking responsibility and correcting the mistake at your end.Had the refund been processed correctly, I would have received it on my credit card at least two weeks ago. This delay is not only inconvenient but completely unprofessional. As a paying customer, I expect better from a brand that purports to value customer satisfaction. The lack of urgency in resolving this matter is appalling.I demand that you take immediate action to resolve this issue. Please confirm when the refund will be processed and credit my account without any further delays. If this issue is not resolved within the next 48 hours, I will have no choice but to escalate the matter and consider taking further action to ensure my rights as a consumer are respected.I expect a prompt resolution to this matter.Sincerely,"
"My Disappointing Experience with LAAMI am incredibly dissatisfied with my experience with LAAM. I‚Äôve been constantly redirected from one person to another without any real solutions. After multiple issues with my order, they claimed they would resend my clothing, yet that still hasn‚Äôt happened.According to the tracking information, LAAM is based in Lahore, and I provided a delivery address in Lahore. However, my package was inexplicably sent from Lahore to Faisalabad. When I raised this issue, they boldly insisted that Faisalabad was not the final destination‚Äîas if I wouldn‚Äôt notice! It‚Äôs clear that the package was sorted there, handed to a courier, and ultimately delivered to someone named ‚ÄúMoiz‚Äù in Faisalabad. I have no idea who this person is, nor do I know anyone by that name. I requested proof of delivery, yet LAAM has failed to provide any evidence.Additionally, it‚Äôs completely unacceptable that they send items separately rather than as one package. This means someone has to be home multiple times to receive each item individually. The lack of coordination and professionalism has been extremely frustrating.I expected better service from LAAM, but this experience has been nothing but a series of disappointments. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to order by LAAM never again. To make matters worse, I suspect that LAAM might be engaging in some kind of bookkeeping fraud, given the inconsistencies I‚Äôve experienced with both their communication and tracking information."
I received my parcel and was beautiful it arrived on time I love this website I will order for sure again
"The customer service is horrible. If you experience any issues, you will not be helped. I have ordered from them a few times and each time one outfit doesn‚Äôt get shipped and usually the one that I wanted the most. When customer service is contacted they just apologize and blame in on the brand and cancel that one item. They have flat shipping rate and that is why I usually order multiple outfits and they never send all of them. On their website the item shows available but then the don‚Äôt ship it to you for no charge. They want to charge you again for shipping. They really don‚Äôt care for their clients and want to scam them so we as consumers can pay extra shipping. It‚Äôs sad that they are scamming their clients and continue to send automated responses versus calling and talking to their guest even after being asked multiple times to be called."
"I was sent a wrong size,i requested a size exchange but i was asked to mail back the outfit get a refund and place another order.I paid for the courier and sent the outfit to them.it has been a month now and i still haven‚Äôt received my refund.They use stalling tactics and tell me every week that i will receive the refund next week.i have a thread of 55 emails with them by now!extremely appalling and disgusting unprofessional customer service"

"I had 2 previously good experiences with this company, but they're customer service is terrible. I had placed an order on October 28th and I tried to cancel it in November because it was taking too long to ship but they assured me that it would ship out on the estimated day or before. The estimated shipping day passed. It didn't ship the following day. I requested to cancel my order. They advised me to do it myself through the app so I did. I got an alert that I had a charge for almost $400 Canadian on my credit card from LAAM the amount of the order that I canceled so instead of refunding it they charged me twice for the same order. So now it's close to $800 Canadian that I've been charged front order they've never received. I've been waiting for someone to refund me or get back to me, I've sent them screenshots of the charges and they just ignore it. If it was one or $200 I think I would be probably let it go but almost $800 is a lot of money. Please save yourself the headache."
i am upset with this aap i want to speak with some one about my order no body cintqct with me i sent email text on whts aap no body contact and i also try to call but nobody picked up my call .i order some dreses when i recieve there is missing one trouser .
"I recently purchased a few outfits, and while most of them were fine, one didn't match the color displayed on the website. The difference was quite noticeable, so I immediately reached out to request a return. To my surprise, they refused, citing a 'color disclaimer' on their website. This is very disappointing, especially since the item was unworn and still in its original packaging. I understand slight color variations can happen, but the discrepancy was too large to ignore. The refusal to accept a return feels unfair and unprofessional. I expected better customer service and would caution others to be aware of this before purchasing."
Absolutely awesome customer care and courteous team. Returns and Returns were speedy!
Very frustrating Payment options. I have tried multiple international credit cards from USA. All of them Decline.What a frustration.....What a bad service most of time cards are declining for payment and I use different cards for payment... Seriously very bad service not at all happy with this online service..No one is helping out and responding so late...and really frustrating service.
"I‚Äôve ordered earlier so ordering again wasn‚Äôt an issue. This time, I was charged AED 7 extra on an order or AED 207 to which they had no response. Then despite of mentioning PKR 1500 shipping fee, I paid additional AED 25 to a local courier here which I didn‚Äôt pay the last time I ordered. I sent an email to which some zainab pervaiz replied and her email ended with ‚Äú I am closing this chat for now. Do rate the chat.‚Äù. I hope laam teaches their staff some basic manners. When will these brands understand they‚Äôre nothing without their customers? What is with this terrible rude attitude I don‚Äôt understand"
"I placed an express order 15 days ago and communicated with LAAM 32 times when I couldn't find any update on shipment and I was told every time ""dont worry, we have reached out to carrier"". I informed them  yesterday that i had to buy the clothes locally since my package is lost and I want refund. I was provided with a tracking link which is displaying the following alert "" Latest UpdateThe package associated with this tracking number did not have proper postage applied and will not be delivered. You are encouraged to contact the sender/merchant to seek reshipment, refund or other available recourse.""Apparently no one at LAAM customer service can read or comprehend this message and I am sent another generic email "" When your LAAM order is shipped internationally, the courier must comply with local customs regulations, and any customs duties required to clear the shipment are the responsibility of the recipient.""Constant lies, unethical, fraudulent business? Most frustrating online shopping experience ever."
"I have ordered from Laam many times and service has been good. On this occasion I decided to have a made to measure outfit made (lehnga ¬£500). but they stitched the top 1.5 inches short and the arms 1 inch short aswell. I have a wedding in 2 weeks with an outfit that looks ridiculous. Here‚Äôs my order  number - 1382616Todays date-22.10.24Now I have 7 days left for the wedding, this problem has still not been resolved. I have contacted Laam and the manufacturer on many occasions explaining the Lehnga top has been sewn short and sleeves are also short. I have submitted videos and images to show them how wrong the measurements are. Laam keep saying they‚Äôre dealing with the matter but I have no updates as to how they‚Äôll resolve this problem."
"Awful experience. No one from customer service is replying Ordered a dress over a month ago and they promises delivery by this Monday. Now they are saying they don't have the item in stock No one is replying to WhatsApp messages, Instagram messages or emails?! They have stolen money and are not sending the dress. Thw same dress is available direct from the brand website as immediate delivery"
I recently purchased a set from Laam. It was a bridal set and it also arrived without the dupatta!! What is going on with Laam where they mislead people and are sending incomplete sets without the dupatta. Its useless with out the correct dupatta. The net was also torn and badly stained. When I contacted them to address this issue they refused to send the dupatta. After many emails they finally offered a small discount and since there was nothing I could do I was forced to accept the amount BUT there has been no refund to date. This company is totally untrust worthy. They pay for good reviews but their customer service is pathetic. VERY UNTRUTHFUL!!!
Please please please do not buy from laam. They send me suit sets. One of them have totally different color of shirt and bottom. The second one is in white color . There are yellow stains all over and seems are not intact. I asked them to take it back and no wonder they refused. They are forcing me to keep it . What would i do with those suits? I am not able to wear it. Its been two days no one is answering me properly. I am asking to refer me to higher authority is answering me as per his convenience. I am stuck. Someone told me that they are literally frauds. I wish i never placed an order. I am still keeping the jutti i ordered and m not asking shippinh charges back. But still they are not refunding money for defective suits.
I bought 3 unstitched churidaar. 2 were very good. One was simply terrible. I got another churidaar and it was stched size 44 with the label removed. When i received my items i sent a message by whatsapp. They told me it was too late. I explained that it was not too late since the parcel had to be reforwarded abroad. If they refund me i will give them 5 stars. Order number 1429372
"Update: 16/10/24Reached out on October 13th again via WhatsApp, spoke with a different representative Noor Fatima who resolved my matter within minutes. It turned out that I only had to cancel one item that didn't make it to the warehouse (Rang Riwaj), got my refund for the cancelled item immediately and my order dispatched within 24 hours. I was so worried about the shipping time but it took only about 2 days to get here! The clothing is accurate to its pictures on the website, only one of them seemed a different color to the picture (Meraki), but the quality is decent, true to its size and I'm overall happy with this purchase! Thank you once again to Asma and Noor for their support!-I‚Äôm leaving this detailed review to help those considering purchasing from LAAM understand what they might be getting into.This experience is my first time as a customer. I have a wedding to attend in November which came up on short notice and since I have a strict time schedule and limited access to branded ethnic clothing (I live in the UAE), I placed a large order of 9 items on August 31st, 2024. For reference, the brands I purchased were:1) Mehak Yaqoob2) Haseens Official3) Mannat4) Hem5) Sarwar Jaan6) Meraki7) Henna Mehndi8) Rang Riwaj9) ArooshIt was stated that my order would ship by October 11th, which was a bit risky for my timeline, but I decided to take the chance. Looking back now, this was a miscalculated decision to make.For context, LAAM's website has an order status feature that gives you an overview of your order's progress. It's divided into tabs like ‚ÄúTo Ship,‚Äù ‚ÄúShipped,‚Äù ‚ÄúDelivered,‚Äù etc. You get the idea. On September 6th, I also made my first contact with customer service via WhatsApp. I asked if I would be receiving my items separately or all at once. I requested that they be shipped together and I was reassured that everything would be shipped in a single package. But, that was a given with international orders anyway as listed on their website. I was also informed that the delivery would take 10-12 days which seemed reasonable at the time. I was pretty satisfied up to this point. By October 7th, 7 out of the 9 items had reached LAAM's warehouse and were marked as ‚ÄúTo Ship.‚Äù However, the two remaining items (Rang Riwaj and Aroosh) were still pending from the brand's seller.This had me concerned about whether my order would ship on time, so I reached out to customer service again through WhatsApp. A representative named Asma Manzoor reassured me and said I had the option to cancel the two delayed items. She had also said that one of the items (Aroosh) would arrive to the warehouse on the scheduled shipment day, and I would receive tracking information once my order shipped. I appreciated the transparency and attention to detail from her end. I also received an email with an automated ticket assigned from the team with a message that said to have my package shipped ASAP. The only odd thing about it was that it had a series of number that didn't match my order number but I assumed it was related to the ticket. I was still feeling positive at this point.  Shipment day arrives (October 11th), and I receive no update or email. I visit the website and my order status remains as ‚ÄúTo Ship.‚ÄùI contacted customer service again via WhatsApp on October 12th to ask if my package had been shipped. This time, an unidentified agent informed me that they were still waiting for the two delayed items before they could ship the package. I wasn‚Äôt aware, nor had I been informed, that LAAM doesn‚Äôt ship international orders unless all items are ready. Apparently, to receive items separately, you have to request partial shipments, which includes extra charges and this option is not always available for international orders. Now, this annoyed me. It would have been nice to know this sooner, especially after the shipment date had passed?! I asked the agent to cancel the delayed items and ship the rest of my order, as I couldn‚Äôt afford further delays. Shipping already takes 10-12 days, and I need these items before November. The agent apologized and said that the delay was due to production issues from the brand. I found myself explaining twice that they should cancel the delayed items and ship the rest of my order. I even pointed out that the previous agent, Asma, had already assigned a ticket to have my package shipped. It turns out the ticket number assigned to me was for someone else's order and they mistakenly emailed me. Seriously?! I pointed out this error to them and they didn‚Äôt even bother to apologize for it.The agent then asked me how I wanted to proceed, despite me already making it clear twice that I wanted the remaining items shipped without delay. This entire process has been stressful and frustrating.I will keep updating this review as the situation progresses."
"I made a big order for my wedding and Laam responded by saying they did not receive the money even though I have showed them every proof and statement that the cheque has been cleared by them and has been credited into their account, my bank said I cannot even reverse the transaction because the cheque has been cleared and only they can refund me but they are not even admitting to receiving the deposit. Seems like a huge scam."
"Disappointing Experience with Laam.pkI recently ordered 4 outfits from Laam ( Order #: 1395024). I ordered  27th August  and received  October 4th.The  experience was extremely disappointing.Cheap materials used for all outfits One of the outfit from Fanoor Official.  poorly made, cannot be even  alter. 2nd: Kiara 3pc Pret Liliam: it has no dupatta, without a dupatta there is no use of that dress.although others are cheap meterial  I only requested refund for Kiara suit  (missing dupatta one), theyinitially offered 15% refund, then 30% now 50%. What do I do with 50% refund? Now I escalated to manager. There are 11th email back and forth with LAAM employee Rabbia   Arshad. This is very unacceptable and unprofessional. My experience With LAAM: Poor Quality, Incomplete Order, and Unprofessional Refund Policy.I will never order from Laam again. Their business practices are questionable, and customer satisfaction seems to be irrelevant."
"This is Delivery to UK.Originally ordered 4 dresses on Sept 8th, on order (Order 1408509) said it will dispatch on oct 7th, 3 dresses were ready but fourth was not and very delayed which I only knew because I was monitoring and emailing, so I had to cancel the 4th dress and I asked them to deliver as the event was on oct 17th,The dresses are delivered, 2 of the 3 are ok. One of the dresses i ordered a Small Size the trouser is 46 inches long, how can I wear it, i messaged them on whats app and they asked for pictures and measure with the tape on. even if I wear it to the highest waist its overflowing and ridiculously HUGE. This morning after all the messages they are offering me 10% compensation for a dress I cannot wear, which is ridiculously LARGE. I have messaged them to say I want my money back for the dress. I will keep you posted on the outcome!3hrs later: So 3 hrs after the 10% compensation they have offered 20%. what do they expect me to do with 20% when I cannot wear the dress.2hrs later : Now they have offered 30% - I dont understand why they are bartering instead of giving a full refund.FINALLY they have accepted to refund fully. it will take 7-10 days for it to appear in my account. I will update again once I actually receive it.Oct 17th 2024 - I do not have the refund yet!I have messaged Laam who say it will take a few more days, when I ask them what date was the refund issued, no response yet!Oct22nd 2024 - I finally see the refund in my account. Thank you"
"I have ordered soooo many clothes from Laam. All were beautiful, Agha Jann, Abhan Zohan etc. So for Diwali, I ordered an expensive 3 piece Gold Kalidar by Marium Bukhari for 26,000 and 8500 shipping. It arrived ,,BUT the material was not very good. I could still be ok with it, but there was NO dupatta. Obviously ruined my Diwali outfit plans :-( I have emailed customer service. Lets see what they do about it."
"Excellent! Their customer service team are amazing! Professional , understanding and considerate.  Highly recommended üëå I especially recommend asma manzoor who dealt with my situation extremely efficiently!"
Pathetic service! lack of communication charge bloody lots of money and send incorrect product.... not recommended
"I would give 0 stars if there was an option for this. I placed orders for 4 suits on 31st July, waited over two weeks for orders to be delivered in Pakistan, I am in the UK made payment via Debit Card? They took the money out straight away paid ¬£183 for the suits.They then called the contact number on the order to say that address was not full on order, so my cousin gave them the correct address three times and even offered to come pick up the suits, they kept saying they would deliver, nothing for over a month I then checked account and the suits were sent back to their warehouses, I have now been waiting for over three months for my refund still after several WhatsApp messages and emails being sent back n forth and promises of refund with 7-10 days, it‚Äôs been over three months now and still no refund, I am going to open a case of fraud and scammers with my bank and see if I can get my money back that way. I never received the suits and they refused to refund my money"
"The worst when it comes to customer service! I ordered 4 items each with a separate ship by date but they refused to ship each item as it became ready, rather trying to send everything when the last one was ready. I spent HOURS corresponding with them trying to explain that I needed each one for different events and couldn't wait for the last one to be available for the order to ship. They refused to budge and kept repeating that the order will ship in total when the last one was ready. HORRIBLE!"
"On September 11, I wrote a review regarding my experience with Laam. Their team responded promptly, as they do with everyone, stating that they were looking into my case and would resolve the issue within 2 to 3 business days. It is clear that these people are scammers. I have not received my refund since June 28, despite returning their defective suit. Even today, when I sent them a reminder email, they once again requested an additional 7 to 10 days, just as they have been doing since June 28. These people are committing fraud."
Very frustrating Payment options. I have tied FIVE international credit cards from UK and KSA. All of them Decline. Even Bank Transfers to their bank in PK is declined. Their USA bank is not identified! What a frustration.....
Very very bad experience its all lies and fake... just pay and forget your order
"I purchased 2 suits and couldn't be happier. Both outfits are absolutely gorgeous and I love them! It was my first time ordering from Laam and I thought my outfits would arrive in about 2 months. However, I received them in 8 days. (Canada) I was shook! Once I recevied the outfits, I was a little nervous because it's very rare I order online, however, as I opened one outfit I just knew they were going to be 10/10. So happy with my purchase and I'm so so excited to order again."
"Scam Alert‚ö†Ô∏è I placed an order of 7 colthes on July 26th 2024 that was a total of almost 200$ I was waiting the whole month and today is 12 Sept, they told me I will receive it on 26th August, they gave me a tracking number that it wasn't tracking from any where else and I was talking to them via WhatsApp but still not the response I wanted and I didn't relieve any thing. In less than 2 months is the wedding of my brother and now I don't know what to do!!!!"
"Update:After going back and forth with Laam they have finally given me a full refund so I have given 3* instead of the initial 1*. Refund policy for international orders should really be extended and customer service really needs some work. Items should be checked thoroughly before being shipped by designer and also Laam!Absolutely disgusting customer service and shame I can't give 0. I received damaged dress with hole and only noticed as I was ironing for wedding function tomorrow. The WhatsApp customer service representative has the audacity to say they can't ""entertain the complaint"" (exact words used) as it's just gone over the 14 day policy and offering me 10% refund for damaged item. I asked to for someone to contact me who's in charge but they won't pass the message on. Totally unacceptable considering the item is unwearable and damaged. What am I going to do with 10% refund!? Stay clear and avoid this company at all costs. Customer service is clearly nonexistent!"
"I recently came across this brand and decided to look up reviews. I was surprised to discover their poor service and unethical practices. I was planning to place a large order for my son's wedding, but now I've decided to explore other options because I can't rely on a service with such a questionable reputation."
"Faking that they care for there customers.This is my second time i am writing review about them in 3days!3days back laam replied to my 1st review and texted me on whatsapp as well by saying that my order is shipped.Gave me some tracking number by saying my order is shipped from there end and i can track my order with in 24hours or after 24hours ,guess what again lie ,i cannot track it anywhere which proves that they still didn‚Äôt shipped my order.They gave me fake tracking number .Today its 11th September and i placed my order on 11thAugust .Today its been complete 1month.Thats laam‚Äôs customer service.Yesterday texted them again to check that i can‚Äôt track my order then simply they replied to me we are sorry but there is some internal glitch due to which your parcel is not assigned to any courier company for shipping yet.I told there Whatsapp representative at-least they can send my parcel via express shipping now because i waited for 1 month ,and she or he simply replied please wait for 48hours and after that only via standard shipping your order will be shipped.No courtesy,No serious action to resolve the issue ,just everyday new lie by saying within 24-48hours we will ship which is big lie i know that..Shame on you guys.Don't expect orders if you are not capable of delivering it on given time.Pathetic service."
"Edit: They indeed reached out and offered free shipping and I ended up ordering two more dresses.  Thank you for making this right.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîHad the worst experience with Laam.  I order 3 Haseens Official brand dresses from Laam‚Äôs website.  As per their website my order was supposed to be shipped on September 3rd.  On September 3rd 2024, I initiated the follow up on my order, where they tell me that 2 out of my 3 dresses were not sent by the vendor(Haseen‚Äôs).  After wasting my 3 days they tell me that Vendor will send the dresses in the week on September 9th.  On September 8th I get an email saying one of my dresses was cancelled, I wrote back to them right away letting them know I need to place a new order for a new dress and want all 3 to be sent at the same time in the same delivery, because I have already payed delivery for 3 dresses, however I get a separate email that a refund has been issued for the dress that they have cancelled and got another email stating that 2 other dresses have been shipped already.  I clearly told them I need to place an order for a 3rd dress!!! I asked them to at-least send me a coupon for free delivery for the 3rd dress which was clearly their fault for not following up with the vendor!  They refused saying it‚Äôs their policy that customer pays delivery.Their customer service agents Areba and Misbah don‚Äôt know what customer service is.  I kept telling them I want to speak on the phone with a manager but they didn‚Äôt answer.They have lost a customer."
"I wish I could give 0 stars........I just placed an order on the website but the order number is not generated and i haven't received any email confirmation either. And when i try to copy the order number it shows: undefined. They charged my card and i am not getting anything. I feel like i am being spammed and ghosted.When I tried to reach out to them on whatsapp, they just replied: Hi, I hope you are doing wellPlease provide me your email ID so I can check the details :)After that no reply, nothing....Radio silence.I've emailed them as well but no responseI've placed so many orders in the past never had any issues before But this time i feel like i am being spammed and ghosted."
Please don't buy from this website...the quality of the clothes is not just cheap but it's cheapest...and they deliver after 3 to 4 months with no good customer service...save money and save your time for God Sake.
"Looking for Pakistani outfits to be delivered safely to Canada, exactly as shown in the pictures? Laam is the best place to order Pakistani outfits. I would have given 5 stars if their WhatsApp service was better. If you overlook the chat service they offer through WhatsApp, they are the best!Thanks Team Laam."
"Laam's customer service is poor, I purchased a beautiful dress for Henna function from the Haseen office brand on July 9, 2024, and Laam was supposed to ship the order on August 19, 2024. However, they delayed the shipment until August 31, 2024. When I contacted Laam on August 31, they informed me that the dress was out of stock. Laam should have informed the customer when their brand is out of stock and marked it as such.  I received a partial refund. I have messaged them multiple times on WhatsApp, I will not make any future purchases from them."
Update :-After a long Argument and Pissed situations...the courier delivered the parcel...and upon looking at the address written on the package we came to know that the sender ( their website) didn't write the full or proper address which was totally their fault.But still I am happy that at last i got the suits and their quality is good ...So this is the update and final review.2- Your website showed the status of my order is cancelled and your whatsapp reply upon asking was the same. Before ordering i gave all details phone number address etc... and its in your policy of shipping that you will call customer before delivering the order so that they can be home at that time frame...but noone called and you just cancelled the order ...Every courier company make a second or 3rd attempt at least leave a ticket so that the receivers can go and get the package by themselves after the failure attempts.Please improve your customer service and hire a REAL agent to talk/chat with customers. Your AI system is so annoying.Still I am ready to edit this review if I will get my order within 1 week ...and plz make sure to instruct the courier to call before they are going to deliver my order within a time frame.Thanks 1-Don't buy from them ...they are a bunch of liars...I ordered 3 suits online...paid fully on their website...order has to deliver in Karachi although i live outside the country but to save time i gave my address in Karachi....after 2 days i saw the status as shipped...i waited 5 days but no delivery...then all of a sudden my order status changed from shipped to cancelled... I asked the reason of cancellation on their whatsapp number which gave me only automated answers...there was no address or direct number of their business...no real customer service agent to talk with...i was feeling so helpless ...they cancelled the order without giving me my refund even after shipping....how is this appropriate ???? So disappointed with them.
I ordered festive collection from Allys and malhaar and everyone loved the dresses üòç
Ordered cloths for nearly USD 500 from Saudi Arabia. Sent money via bank transfer. They cancelled the order saying money did not reach in 4 days. Now my money is with them. They declined to admit money in in their account. Now saying they can not refund the money back to my saudi account. How come they sell to customers all over the world and receive money from around the world but can't refund !. Please be cautious with LAAM. I am still waiting for my money.
Products are very nice. I have great experience with there services most of the time.
I ordered 9 outfits from Laam.pk. They sent me 7 out of the 9 while the other 2 arrived 2 weeks later than promised. The outfits that came are very very bad quality. Ordered extra small but some of the pieces are extra large. They have promised a world of a customer service but I am literally not n tears with poor communication and poor service.  They say on the website that we give ultimate customer satisfaction and 14 day return policy. It‚Äôs all a scam. They are charging you exorbitant amount of money for something that costs them dirt cheap. And us international clients relying on the description given by the designers of how great the material is turns out it‚Äôs paper thin and see through. No muslim woman can wear those outfits in public. It quite shameful that the CEO Arif Iqbal is minting mega millions without a proper check of quality control. I‚Äôm still fighting for the past 3 weeks for my refund of the defective low quality paper thin and cheap looking clothes. Hope someone replies soon and take some needed action. ASAP!!!!Please don‚Äôt order from Laam.pk without doing due diligence. Disappointed & Disgusted
"This was the second time I ordered from LAAM and they've improved their service considerably. I paid flat rate shipping with duties and customs included. I didn't have to worry about paying anything at the door or over the phone when my parcel arrived in Canada. It took 7 days from the day the parcel left Pakistan to get to my doorstep, which was impressive. The clothing is of great quality (be sure to read product description for info on fabric and choose accordingly). Everything is as shown online (minus the colour of one pair of shoes) and fits better than expected. I had to cancel one item in my order before dispatch because it was delaying the rest of my order. I contacted LAAM through Whatsapp to initiate a refund and they processed it quickly and I received my refund in a matter of a few days. Overall, I'm very happy with the items I ordered and the customer service I received. Will definitely be ordering again."
Everything was better then was shown. On time delivery nicely packed and all clothes are very good better then pictures! Great experience highly recommend!
"With honesty, laam team has been helpful throughout my experience, I'm 100% satisfied and my wife is satisfied with the clothes, In Sha Allah we will keep purchasing more and more."
"Do not fall for the $25 shipping to the US scam. Your hair will turn grey watching the package you have already paid for bounce around between cities and not get delivered to you for weeks on end. Pathetic service. Order broken up into multiple shipments and not getting delivered. And no way to contact LAAM or the carrier on the phone. A useless What‚ÄôsApp interface for LAAM with no real time replies (they reply about an hour after you send them a message with useless platitudes) and a Pakistan contact number for skynet that you will pay a fortune per minute calling, only to be told that your package is on its way. Never ordering from LAAM again EVER."
"I would give a NO stars rating if it was possible. The worst company to purchase from! I received my suits today and one of them was of such bad quality, the stitching coming apart on the embroidery, pearls falling off one after the other upon taking it out of the package. I sent customer service an email and was informed in writing after providing sufficient evidence a refund will be initiated. I was then sent a link in which I had to request a refund? Again, I did what was requested of me. I was then sent a email requesting the same explanation which I had already shared in my initial email. I forwarded all my correspondence I had with the customer service representative along with live video footage. After being messed around I was told that return labels will not be sent and only 18% refund can be issued, what a joke! Laam you may NOT have consumers protection act in Pakistan but we do have in the U.K where we are protected from fraudulent retailers like yourself. I have contacted my bank and they will be pursuing a back payment from your company. Avoid this company, their clothing is of poor quality and their customer service is absolutely awful. Response to your message below! Yes you have NOW agreed to refund my money, but you tried your upmost best not give me a full refund. After sending you various emails and then having to put in a claim through my bank, you decided to initiate a refund. How much undue stress did I have to go through before you decided it was the right thing to do? I am still waiting for the refund, I will believe it when I see it in my account. If not my bank will pursue it on my behalf."
Do not purchase from laam they are fraud company. Won‚Äôt give your package and won‚Äôt give your money back.
"The deals they offered and the quality of the brands I ordered from, both were very satisfying. I hope it works for everyone and it‚Äôs  the same for all the brands come under their umbrella."
It was my first time ordering from laam.The design as shown in the picture the fit the stitching the colour everything was on point.Overall a great experience.Absolutely ordering more.
"Great experience, I oftenly shop from laam.They provide 100 percent original branded clothee"
"Dress was same as it was shown, delivery was also on time ..... thumbs up"
Wonderful product veryy satisfied Laam is best
It was my first experience with Laam.. and it was a great experience... Dress is pretty as shown in the picture üòç I'll shop again insha'Allah
It's my first time.... And very great experience with laam team.... JazakAllah for your support.... Each n everything is perfect.
"It's not same abaya which I order ,Change in stitching not satisfied"
I have received my order such a great product as always. Thnx Laam keep up the quality as well as always.
Quick and easy to deal.
Ordered last Thursday 8th and arrived today Monday 12th! Thoroughly impressed and the dress is so beautiful Alhamdullilah. Definitely recommend üòç
I have been a Laam customer for over a year now. I have ordered many dresses from Laam. The quality of all the  dresses are very good. Laam has a very great collection of dress. Thank you
I love the outfit and the customer service was very supportive
I have ordered on 21 june 2024 I have paid online from uk and they asked me through email if u not paid ur order will be cancelled then Laam cancelled an order and still now I m struggling for payment they have no live chat which is unreasonable if they have no call service then they should have a live message service when u messaged them they replied after one day and when u answered the what they asked then again wait for one day they are saying me your refund will be issued in 6 8 days but still now I m waiting for refund for order 1314965
The quality is great and two embroidery patches also include in it .Thanks
"In time delivery  with nice packing ,fine fabric  ,neat embroidery, and discount was not available on Designers website but Laam offered a discount. First experience but great experience"
"It was my first and best experience with laam, really loved the dresses, thank you!!"
Mra experience laam k sath bht Acha hn me jab v order kiya bht e Acha aya or same aya
Excellence range of collection.
"I am amazed by the quality of the dresses. This was my first time buying from LAAM. I highly recommend people, specially living in abroad to purchase from the LAAM. Just keeping one thing in mind whatever you buy, make sure you have plenty of time in hand, sometimes the delivery/shipping takes longer."
I receive my parcel and the dress is exactly same as shown in picture ....stuff of dress is also very good ....very good experience....and the dress delivered within 3 days. ...highly recommended....
Laam k sath bht acha experience raha Mera dress safely mere pass aya or is page pe apko hr range me dress mil jata he so laam is best
"As an overseas customer I would always struggle to know latest fashion trends in Pakistan..when in Pakistan, I'd spend days going from mall to mall looking for renowned brands till...I FOUND LAAM!! Now I can get my favourite brands at reasonable prices with a few clicks on my phone. All I ever wanted from Pakistani outfits is available on LAAM. To top it off, they have hired a great team who understand and value their customers.LAAM you have me as your loyal customer :)"
"Laam have a huge variety to shop from. I had ordered for a wee girls night out and took the risk as I needed the outfit for 29th July 2024. Loved their fixed shipping at ¬£22, which got me shopping more than one outfit coz I thought why not, 9 items in total. I have shopped from Laam.PK before for Pakistani delivery and have delivered as promised. But first time ordered for home delivery to the UK. I placed order on Tuesday 23rd July 2024 at somewhere around 2am. ordered all items due to be sent on same day 24th July 2024. Parcel Arrived on Friday 26th July 2024. I must say I was impressed and cannot stop telling everyone how amazing it was to receive my order direct to my home from Pakistan in postage time in 2 days. Btw I didn‚Äôt use any express delivery option, it was the standard delivery I used. Thank you very much."
"ORDER boardetic 240620024459511. I have purchased dresses for USD 39.95 at YKL*callitor on 19/06/2024. So far no product delivered at Abu Dhabi. But they falsely replied me over email as they delivered. When I choose their link for online chat, they are asking to pay USD 1. It seems to be a cyber criminal from Pakistan"
Good experience
"I ordered dresses 3 months ago. Still not received.. No further solution, no investigation where products has been delivered. Really frustrating.Hope company refund me the amount I paid"
Don't buy from this website. Bad quality and no option to return.
I'm very happy.  Dresses made to order from Laam are always nice and great.  I am very satisfied.
Great shopping experience. The items arrived in perfect condition. Reliable service and excellent customer-service.
I ordered 2 items from laam on 22 May. Made a prepaid payment with my UAE bank card. It said delivery before Eid. To my surprise it took them 2 months and after repeated followups they said the dresses are out of stock. So they cancelled both my items one after another. Now coming to the refund they refunded only one item. The other item amount is still not returned even after 20 days of cancellation. Now they aren‚Äôt responding to my WhatsApp nor emails. It is a fraud guys. Do not order from them.
I am Laam's regular customer since last year. Bcz of the Unbeatable and Unbelievable discounts on Original Branded items. And what I absolutely like about them is their Cooperative and humble Team with always prompt replies.
"I‚Äôm so disappointed with my experience this time with Laam. They‚Äôve shown major unprofessionalism and I‚Äôm writing this review here so no one else gets scammed by them like I did. I ordered a beautiful embellished maxi dress from them for a very close family wedding, it came on time, looks just like the picture and everything BUT, the sizing chart they provided for this article was inaccurate and because of this, this dress did not fit me once it arrived. I based my purchase off the sizing chart they provided and when I tried it on it got stuck from the chest/armhole area because all true measurements were 1 inch less than what was displayed online. I contacted them asking them for a refund because their criteria for refund policy states an incorrect size or wrong sizing chart will qualify for refunds, they then offer me 20% refund for a dress I spent $156 on (plus shipping) and when I refused they respond by sending the following message:  ‚ÄúDear, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. After reviewing the measurements, we found that the bust has only a 1-inch difference from the mentioned size, and the same applies to the armhole.As a gesture of goodwill, we would like to offer you a 30% refund. We hope you can accept this, as it is our maximum profit that we can offer.Thank you for your understanding :)Kind Regards,Team LAAM‚ÄùThis is their message word for word and I‚Äôm just shocked a big name like theirs would think that a 30% refund is in anyway ethical when I spent so much money on their product! Never again will I be purchasing from them and I hope y‚Äôall steer away from them too after reading this. Save your time and money and go elsewhere where business ethics are a thing."
I have a good experience with laam i am so happy everything get perfect and on time alhamduilah
"Laam has a great selection of dresses. No matter what kind your looking for they have it all from lawn, cotton, Khaddar, chiffon, net as well as stiched and unstitched! This was my first time buying from laam after seeing and hearing so much about them and after receiving my package I will definitely be buying more! Love being able to see all different Pakistani designer brands in one space at a pretty decent price point! Give Laam a try especially if you want to support Pakistani designers!"
Best quality best dress
Good quality product. And lots of variety.shipping and delivery was smooth.came on time.overall experience was nice. Will purchase more in future.
I m a already customer of laam and have purchased many dresses i believe laam. Laam give us trust and send us 100% original. Fabrics are amazing and branded. I like to shop here again and again and there shipping is so good staff is so calm and educated.
"The outfit that I ordered was beautiful and elegant. I loved it. Size was perfect too! Also, I bought 2 khussas which were comfortable and beautiful. I highly recommend this store to anyone who is looking for ELEGANT OUTFITS!"
Everything about this dress was so pretty. It was exactly how it was shown in picture. I am soo happy with my purchase and would love to shop again

"Good quality fabric, stylish and trendy designs, beautiful embroidery and reasonable prices is what differentiates Laam from its competitors. I love all the dresses I ordered. They are so beautiful just as they are in the pictures on their website. The tailoring and fitting is also just perfect.  A smooth transaction, efficient shipping, fast delivery and excellent customer service are the key features a customer looks for when shopping online and Laam‚Äôs advanced web portal takes care of them. I am overall very happy with the entire great shopping experience I had at Laam. Looking forward to do my regular shopping at Laam. Thank you for providing this great quality service and pls continue to do so."
My experience with laam very good.fabric quality is very Good stitching also Nice
"If you are looking something for important event, STAY AWAY from this site. The customer service is crap and no help at all. They have ruined the wedding event for whole family. You cant get help on Whatsapp and conversation is closed."
"Great experience using LAAM , Will surely recommend it to everyone."
"Impressed with stitching and sizes, most of the colour and fabric matched up with photos, however some of them were slightly different.Delay delivery is certainly concerned, but all over i m happy"
i had great experiance shopping with laam my delivery was on the date i was allocated very good  customer services  i recommend laam shopping to all my friends and family
Great experience but late time received please fast your delivery management
"I wish there were 0 stars. Ordered in March 2024 and haven't received yet(July 2024). Whenever we asked about missing clothes, the reply was ""processed"" ..stopped replying after and never refunded money."
"Original product, in time delivery.Highly recommended"
what ever when ever I order I it on with great quality
"I had great experience, my order was on time I really loved it ..."
Good quality and on time.. same as shown in the pictures.. i like it
we ordered from Saudi Arabia. next day we got a message saying our money has been refunded!. they would not tell us why they would not send our order ? specifically asked why our order was not dispatched and they refunded the money. They would not address the question. very annoyed. How could we buy again with confidence if they would not even tell what the problem was ? dissapointed.
After a wait of 2months they said sorry we couldn't deliver the suit n refunded me.n they have no return policy for Overseas u get what u get either its size n materialIs absurd but u need to keepIt coz they r not returning n refunding.it happened to me last eid.
"I had an issue with an article that was missing a piece, and it was resolved promptly. The company was very understanding and demonstrated strong ethics. It's clear they truly care about their customers.Thank you!"
Thank you so much. I have received my parcel.From you Laam.The dress is soo beautiful i am impressed from you the Laam the dress of laal clothing.And your delivery service is soo fast thank you so much.
Great experience wt  wonderful discount fast dlv n marvelous communication
"Really disappointed. I m writing to notify my concern to the management that on 12 April I purchased 5 items from laam.pk worth 27000 rs. order number 1761033 and 1761045 with under the title of ***********. today i received a call from phone number 03468677094 and the person calling himself as representative of laam, that my order is set for returns by the rider because his network was not working and now cod is not available, i ve to online transfer my money to the rider (transfer of money image attached) within half an hour my parcel will be delivered. but they are not responding to any call now. the above mentioned number picked up call but when I told my name they simply cut off the line.i m very upset and want either the items i ordered or a quick refund. You can confirm from the person who is responsible for the phone."
"Very poor, very bad, very useless, very unprofessional customer care services. If there is any problem they will drive you crazy and you will be confused about what will happen next and they will remain silent and your money will be compromised, so be careful with online transactions and refunds."
"I was surprised by their quick and fast delivery as I placed my order on the 3rd April in the UK and received it on the 9th of April.All of the items were as described on their website except the quality of one of the 3 piece embroidered and stitched suit from ‚ÄòChaudhary Arts‚Äô, which I wasn't impressed with. The threads of the embroidery were not cut properly and there was no finishing and quality seemed poor.Anyway I would give 4 stars for fast shipping and rest of the items that I ordered."
"I had a disappointing experience with Laam. They advertise ‚ÄúExpress Shipping within one day for Canada,‚Äù which is misleading and it only means they dispatch in a day from there side, but delivery actually takes 7‚Äì12 business days. My order arrived late despite multiple follow-ups, and tracking updates were unreliable.When the parcel finally arrived, the quality was poor nothing like what was shown online. The items appeared to be replicas of branded products, with bad stitching and finishing. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying from Laam due to false advertising, selling replicas, delayed shipping, and substandard products."
Alhumdulillah so much good
"They are scam. I ordered from them, paid extra for confirmed pre-eid delivery. Arrived too late after eid. Contacted customer support. No response. Money gone.** do not order from them **"
"Sent out the wrong size trousers smaller than the size ordered. Top was right size. I couldnt wear this outfit incomplete, so emailed them. Not only was half the suit the size wrong the outfit was full of stains as if it had been worn. Muhammad replied to the email, same thing sorry for inconvenience etc... said we can't return the outfit apparently will get stuck in customs. The normal excuse they all use in Pakistan. Offered 35% refund. Even though i couldn't now wear the outfit, which i just accepted. These guys can't even calculate sent me a refund which was way less than the 35%. When emailed them back his reply was we only apply a refund once and you accepted 35% lol yes 35% not 2%. Will never buy again. Outfit was in worst condition."
"Laam, offers the best prices, fast shipping and thier products are exactly how you see them. I have order 2 times with them and honestly all of the clothing i had ordered were beautiful in person. The sizes are a little different so make sure to always read the size chart for each designer."
"I spent around $200, but it was a waste of money. The dresses are very cheap and damaged after one use. The fabric used is really bad; even my son's shalwar kameez ripped after the first wear."
"I ordered a Large size, and they sent me XL.The problem is its just two days left in Eid, there is no number where I can call and No Response on their whatsapp number."
"Very bad experience they don‚Äôt have a return policy, they want is measurements pictures even if we don‚Äôt like it they won‚Äôt return items. It‚Äôs all a scam I spent ¬£228 and most of all the suits will shrink and the sizes are not accurate, please don‚Äôt waste ur money.."
"I'm so happy üòä, Beautiful dresses üòç Good service üíØ Fast delivery üëçI just love the dresses ‚ù§Ô∏èThank u Laam üôÇ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Hi I was so excited to receive my order within 6 days which was a lovely surprise. All outfits were packed nicely  and stitched to a high standard which fitted beautifully, . I love the designs and colours. A great experience and very happy.  Thank you Naureen"
Great experience. Fully satisfied

"Worst customer service. I ordered 5 dresses for eid, seems like they ruined my eid. Worst fabrics, worst stitch, stain in tje dress, low quality material. And asking me 5 cad refund. Such a liar, disrespectful business they are doing. Never buy from them please."
I never write negative comments but this was so disappointing that I had to. I love Pakistani suits & hence I ordered 5 dresses from lama for Eid. I was shocked to see the poor stitching & finishing of each dress it was so immature that a person sitting at home without any tools would stitch it better. This was my first and last order from Laam. Very poor quality.
